  english: Now it happened, as He went into the house of one of the rulers of the Pharisees to eat bread on the Sabbath, that they watched Him closely. And behold, there was a certain man before Him who had dropsy. And Jesus, answering, spoke to the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?" But they kept silent. And He took him and healed him, and let him go. Then He answered them, saying, "Which of you, having a donkey or an ox that has fallen into a pit, will not immediately pull him out on the Sabbath day?" And they could not answer Him regarding these things.
  arabic: 'وإذ جاء إلى بيت أحد رؤساء الفريسيين في السبت ليأكل خبزاً كانوا يراقبونه وإذا إنسانٌ مستسقٍ كان قدامه فسأل يسوع الناموسيين والفريسيين: هل يحل الإبراء في السبت فسكتوا فأمسكه وأبرأه وأطلقه ثم سأل: من منكم يسقط حماره أو ثوره في بئرٍ ولا ينشله حالاً في يوم السبت فلم يقدروا أن يجيبوه عن ذلك'
