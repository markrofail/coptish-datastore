  - english: Now there was a man in their synagogue with an unclean spirit. And he cried out, saying, "Let us alone! What have we to do with You, Jesus of Nazareth? Did You come to destroy us? I know who You are--the Holy One of God!" But Jesus rebuked him, saying, "Be quiet, and come out of him!" And when the unclean spirit had convulsed him and cried out with a loud voice, he came out of him. Then they were all amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, saying, "What is this? What new doctrine is this? For with authority He commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey Him." And immediately His fame spread throughout all the region around Galilee. Now as soon as they had come out of the synagogue, they entered the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John. But Simon's wife's mother lay sick with a fever, and they told Him about her at once. So He came and took her by the hand and lifted her up, and immediately the fever left her. And she served them.
    arabic: 'وكان في مجمعهم رجلٌ به روحٌ نجسٌ فصرخ قائلاً: آه ما لنا ولك يا يسوع الناصري أتيت لتهلكنا أنا أعرفك من أنت قدوس الله فانتهره يسوع قائلاً: اخرس واخرج منه فصرعه الروح النجس وصاح بصوتٍ عظيمٍ وخرج منه فتحيروا كلهم حتى سأل بعضهم بعضاً قائلين: ما هذا ما هو هذا التعليم الجديد لأنه بسلطانٍ يأمر حتى الأرواح النجسة فتطيعه فخرج خبره للوقت في كل الكورة المحيطة بالجليل ولما خرجوا من المجمع جاءوا للوقت إلى بيت سمعان وأندراوس مع يعقوب ويوحنا وكانت حماة سمعان مضطجعةً محمومةً فللوقت أخبروه عنها فتقدم وأقامها ماسكاً بيدها فتركتها الحمى حالاً وصارت تخدمهم'
