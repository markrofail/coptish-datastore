  - english: Then it happened, as He was coming near Jericho, that a certain blind man sat by the road begging. And hearing a multitude passing by, he asked what it meant. So they told him that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by. And he cried out, saying, "Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!" Then those who went before warned him that he should be quiet; but he cried out all the more, "Son of David, have mercy on me!" So Jesus stood still and commanded him to be brought to Him. And when he had come near, He asked him, saying, "What do you want Me to do for you?" He said, "Lord, that I may receive my sight." Then Jesus said to him, "Receive your sight; your faith has made you well." And immediately he received his sight, and followed Him, glorifying God. And all the people, when they saw it, gave praise to God.
    arabic: 'ولما اقترب من أريحا كان أعمى جالساً على الطريق يستعطي فلما سمع الجمع مجتازاً سأل: ما عسى أن يكون هذا فأخبروه أن يسوع الناصري مجتازٌ فصرخ: يا يسوع ابن داود ارحمني فانتهره المتقدمون ليسكت أما هو فصرخ أكثر كثيراً: يا ابن داود ارحمني فوقف يسوع وأمر أن يقدم إليه ولما اقترب سأله: ماذا تريد أن أفعل بك فقال: يا سيد أن أبصر فقال له يسوع: أبصر إيمانك قد شفاك وفي الحال أبصر وتبعه وهو يمجد الله وجميع الشعب إذ رأوا سبحوا الله'
