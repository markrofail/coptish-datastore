      "english": "So it was, when the angels had gone away from them into heaven, that the shepherds said to one another, \"Let us now go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has come to pass, which the Lord has made known to us.\" And they came with haste and found Mary and Joseph, and the Babe lying in a manger. Now when they had seen Him, they made widely known the saying which was told them concerning this Child. And all those who heard it marveled at those things which were told them by the shepherds. But Mary kept all these things and pondered them in her heart. Then the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told them.",
      "arabic": "ولما مضت عنهم الملائكة إلى السماء قال الرعاة بعضهم لبعضٍ: لنذهب الآن إلى بيت لحمٍ وننظر هذا الأمر الواقع الذي أعلمنا به الرب فجاءوا مسرعين ووجدوا مريم ويوسف والطفل مضجعاً في المذود فلما رأوه أخبروا بالكلام الذي قيل لهم عن هذا الصبي وكل الذين سمعوا تعجبوا مما قيل لهم من الرعاة وأما مريم فكانت تحفظ جميع هذا الكلام متفكرةً به في قلبها ثم رجع الرعاة وهم يمجدون الله ويسبحونه على كل ما سمعوه ورأوه كما قيل لهم"
