      english: 1. The Commemoration of the Circumcision of the Lord Christ.
      arabic: 1. عيد الختان المجيد
    text:
      english: On this day, the church celebrates the commemoration of the circumcision of the Lord Christ, to Whom is the glory. God had ordained the law of circumcision as a sign that His people would become a particular people over all others. This was that every male of the seed of Abraham be circumcised on the eighth day of his birth. God put every soul that did not obey this law under judgment. As our Lord Jesus was born from the posterity of Abraham, according to the flesh, He willed to be circumcised on the eighth day, to fulfill the law of and to relieve us from the heavy burden of this commandment, as St. Paul says, "Now I say that Jesus Christ has become a servant to the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made to the fathers." (Romans 15:8) He also gave us the sign of the new covenant through baptism, as St. Paul says, "In Him you were also circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, by putting off the body of the sins of the flesh, by the circumcision of Christ, buried with Him in Baptism in which you also were raised with Him, through faith in the working of God, Who raised Him from the dead. And you, being dead in your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, He has made alive together with Him, having forgiven you all trespasses." (Colossians 2:11-13) Therefore, He demands from us to keep the spiritual circumcision, that is to say the circumcision of the heart, so that we may live for Him in righteousness and in holiness, for He says, "Unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the Kingdom of God." (John 3:5) Glory be to our God forever. Amen.
      arabic: في هذا اليوم تحتفل الكنيسة بتذكار ختان السيد المسيح له المجد ، وذلك ان الله كان قد رسم شريعة الختان علامة يتميز بها شعبه عن الشعوب الأخرى وهي ان يختتن كل ذكر من نسل إبراهيم في ثامن يوم من ميلاده ، وقد وضع الرب كل نفس لا تحفظ هذا العهد تحت القصاص ومن ثم إذ كان سيدنا مولودا من نسل إبراهيم بالجسد فقد أراد هو أيضا ان يختتن في ثامن يوم من ميلاده ليكمل الناموس وليعتقنا من ثقل هذه الوصية كما يقول لسان العطر بولس الرسول " ان يسوع المسيح قد صار خادم الختان من اجل صدق الله حتى يثبت مواعيد الآباء " ثم أعطانا علامة العهد الجديد بالمعمودية كما قال الرسول " وبه ايضا ختنتم ختانا غير مصنوع بيد بخلع جسم خطايا البشرية بختان المسيح مدفونين معه بالمعمودية التي فيها أقمتم ايضا معه بإيمان عمل الله الذي أقامه من الأموات . وإذ كنتم أمواتا في الخطايا وغلف جسدكم أحياكم معه مسامحا لكم بجميع خطاياكم . لهذا يريد منا ان نحفظ الختان الروحي أي ختان القلب لنحيا له في الرب والقداسة لأنه " ان كان أحد لا يولد من الماء والروح لا يقدر ان يدخل ملكوت الله . ولربنا المجد إلى الأبد امين. ملاحظة طقسية:عيد سيدى صغير . وطقسه فرابحي وتقرأ فصوله حتى إذا جاء يوم أحد )

      english: 2. The Ascension of Elijah the Prophet.
      arabic: 2. تذكار صعود ايليا النبى الى السماء حيا
    text:
      english: 'Also, on this day was the departure of the prophet Elijah (Elias), the Tishbite, to heaven, alive. This prophet lived during the time of King Ahab. His heart was filled with sorrow, for he saw the king had turned from the worship of the God of Israel to the worship of idols. He followed Queen Jezebel, who helped the priests of Baalzebub. The worship of idols spread out in his days. Therefore, Elijah stood before the king and said, "As the Lord God of Israel lives, before Whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, except at my word." (I Kings 17: 1) Immediately the brooks dried up, for there had been no rain in the land, and the grass dried up and the drought set in the whole land. God however did not forsake his zealous servant. He commanded him to go to the brook of Cherith, and the ravens came to him everyday and brought him bread and meat in the morning and in the evening. The Lord ordered the water of the river to dry, but He did not forsake the prophet Elijah. God commanded him to go to Zarephath, which belonged to Sidon, where he found a widow gathering sticks and he asked her for bread to eat. She said to him, "As the Lord your God lives, I do not have bread, only a handful of flour in a bin and a little oil in a jar; and see, I am gathering a couple of sticks, that I may go in and prepare it for myself and my son, that we may eat it and die." Elijah said to her, "Do not fear; go and do as you have said, but make me a small cake from it first and bring it to me; and afterward make some for yourself and your son. For thus says the Lord God of Israel, ''The bin of flour shall not be used up; nor shall the jar of oil run dry, until the day the Lord sends rain on the earth.''" So she went away and did according to the words of Elijah, and she, the prophet, and her household ate for many days. Elijah stayed with the widow until the drought had ended. She had a son who was sick, and his sickness progressed until he died. The prophet saw the grief of the woman. He took her son from her and carried him to the upper room where he was staying and laid him on his own bed. Then he cried out to the Lord and he stretched himself out on the child three times. The Lord heard the voice of Elijah and the soul of the child came back to him, and he was revived. Elijah took the child and brought him down and gave him to his mother alive. (I Kings 17:17-23) When Jezebel knew that Elijah executed all the priests of Baal by the sword, she threatened to kill him. When he saw that, he arose and ran for his life. He went to Mount Horeb where he hid himself. The Lord talked to him, "What are you doing here, Elijah?" So he said, "I have been very zealous for the Lord God of Hosts; for the children of Israel have forsaken Your covenant, torn down Your altars, and killed Your prophets with the sword. I alone am left, and they seek to take my life." The Lord said to him, "... Yet I have reserved seven thousand in Israel, all whose knees have not bowed to Baal... " (I Kings 19:10-18) When Ahab died and King Ahaziah reigned, he did evil in the sight of the Lord and walked in the way of his father Ahab. Ahaziah fell through the lattice of his upper room in Samaria and was injured. He sent messengers to inquire from Baalzebub, the god of Ekron, whether he would recover from his injury. Elijah, the Prophet, met with his messengers and he told them to go and tell the King, "Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are going to inquire of Baalzebub, the god of Ekron? Now therefore, thus says the Lord! You shall not come down from the bed to which you have gone up, but you shall surely die." When they said this to the King, the King knew that it was Elijah the prophet. The King sent to him a captain of fifty, and the prophet was sitting on the top of the hill. He said to Elijah, "Man of God, the King has said, ''Come down.''" So, Elijah answered and said to the captain, "If I am a man of God, then let fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty men." And the fire came down from heaven and consumed them. Then the King sent another captain of fifty and said to him what the first captain said. And the fire came down from heaven and consumed them. The third captain came to Elijah and fell on his knees before him and pleaded with him. Elijah arose and went down with him to the King whom he rebuked. The King died in his bed. (2 Kings 1:1-18) After that, Elijah went to the Jordan River and he took with him Elijah, his disciple . He struck the water with his mantle, and the river was divided and the two of them crossed over on dry ground. While they were talking to each other, suddenly a chariot of fire appeared with horses of fire, separated the two of them, and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven. (2 Kings 2:1-12) His prayers be with us. Amen'
      arabic: في مثل هذا اليوم كان انتقال النبي ايليا التشبي إلى السماء حيا . وكان هذا النبي في ايام آخاب الملك . وقد غمر قلبه الحزن إذ رأي آخاب الملك قد تحول من عبادة اله إسرائيل إلى عبادة الأوثان وانقاد إلى إيزابيل الملكة التي ساعدت كهنة بعل زبوب ، فأنتشرت عبادة الأوثان في أيامه ، ولذلك وقف أمامه يوما وقال له "حي هو الرب اله إسرائيل الذي وقفت أمامه انه لا يكون طل ولا مطر في هذه السنين إلا عند قولي " وفي الحال جفت الأنهار ويبس العشب وصار القحط والغلاء في الأرض كلها ولكن الله لم يتخل عن عبده الغيور فأمره الرب ان يمضي إلى نهر كريث وكانت الغربان تأتى إليه بخبز ولحم صباحا ومساء . وأمر الله فجف ماء النهر ولكنه لم يترك ايليا ايضا . إذ أمره ان يذهب إلى صرفة صيدا وهناك وجد امرأة أرملة تجمع حطبا فطلب منها خبزا ليأكل فقالت له " حي هو الرب إلهك انه ليست عندي كعكة ولكن ملء كف من الدقيق في الكوار وقليل من الزيت في الكوز وهاأنذا أقش عودين لأتى واعمله لي ولابني لنأكله ثم نموت . فقال لها ايليا لا تخافي ادخلي واعملي كقولك ولكن اعملي لي منها كعكة صغيرة أولا . . . ثم اعملي لك ولابنك أخيرا . لأنه هكذا قال الرب اله إسرائيل ان كوار الدقيق لا يفرغ وكوز الزيت لا ينقص إلى اليوم الذي يعطي الرب مطرا علي وجه الأرض . فذهبت وفعلت حسب قول ايليا وأكلت هي وهو وبيتها أياما . وأقام عند الأرملة إلى انقضاء زمن الغلاء . وكان لها ولد قد مرض واشتد مرضه جدا حتى لم تبق فيه نسمة ورأي النبي حزن المرأة فأخذه منها وصعد به إلى العلية التي كان مقيما بها وصلي لأجله وتمدد عليه ثلاث مرات فسمع الرب لصوت ايليا ورجعت نفس الولد إلى جوفه فعاش فاخذ الولد وأعطاه لامه حيا . ولما علمت إيزابل ان ايليا قد ذبح كهنة البعل هددته بالقتل . فلما رأي ذلك منها صغرت نفسه وذهب إلى جبل حوريب حيث اختبأ فكلمه الرب ما لك ههنا فقال يا رب قتلوا أنبياءك وهدموا مذبحك وبقيت انا وحدي وهم يطلبون نفسي فقال له لا تخف فإني قد أبقيت لي سبعة آلاف ركبة لم تجث للبعل. ولما مات آخاب وملك اخزيا وعمل الشر في عيني الرب سقط من الكوة ومرض فأرسل رسلا إلى اله عقرون ليسألوه ان كان يبرا من هذا المرض . فالتقي ايليا النبي بالرسل وقال لهم قولوا للملك هكذا قال الرب " أليس لأنه لا يوجد في إسرائيل اله تذهبون لتسألوا بعل زبوب اله عقرون . لذلك فأن السرير الذي صعدت عليه لا تنزل عنه بل موتا تموت " . فلما قالوا للملك هذا عرف انه ايليا النبي ، أرسل إليه رئيس خمسين وكان النبي جالسا علي رأس الجبل فقال له القائد يا رجل الله انزل إلى الملك فأجاب إيليا:ان كنت انا رجل الله فلتنزل نار من السماء وتأكلك أنت والخمسين الذين معك . فنزلت نار من السماء وأكلته هو والخمسين الذين له ثم أرسل الملك رئيس خمسين أخر وقال كما قال الأول ونزلت نار وأكلته هو والخمسين الذين له أما الثالث فقد جاء وجثا علي ركبتيه أمام ايليا وتضرع إليه وقال له بإتضاع ، فنزل معه بأمر الوحي وذهب إلى الملك وبكته علي فعله ومات الملك علي سريره . وبعد ذلك مضي إلى نهر الأردن ومعه اليشع تلميذه حيث ضرب الماء بردائه فانفلق إلى نصفين فعبرا كلاهما في اليابس . وفيما هما يتكلمان إذا مركبة من نار وخيل من نار ففصلت بينهما فصعد ايليا في العاصفة إلى السماء . صلاته تكون معنا امين .

      english: 3. The Departure of St. Marcianus, 8th Pope of Alexandria.
      arabic: 3. نياحة البابا مركيانوس ال81
    text:
      english: 'Also on this day in 154 A.D., St. Marcianus, 8th Pope of Alexandria, departed. He was born in Alexandria. When Pope Omanius departed, the fathers of the church gathered with the people of Alexandria and discussed whom they should choose for the vacant throne. By consensus, they chose Marcianus for his intellect and righteousness. He sat on the throne of St. Mark for 9 years, 2 months and 26 days. He was always teaching his flock and protecting the church from all the foreign teachings. When he completed his well pleasing course to God, he departed in peace. His prayers be with us. Amen. 4. The Departure of St. Basil the Great, Bishop Of Caesarea. Today also of the year 379 A.D., the great St. Basil, Bishop of Caesarea, departed. His father''s name was "Isosorus" (Isidore), who was a priest and a holy man. He begot five children: St. Basil of Caesarea, St. Gregory of Nyssa, St. Kisarion (Cherion), St. Peter of Sebastia, and St. Machrina. They all lived in holiness all their lives. He was instructed in the art of rhetoric, at the hands of the philosopher Libianius of Antioch, and he worked as an advocate. In 358 A.D., he abandoned the world and all its vain glories. He travelled through the wilderness of Egypt, where he witnessed the ascetics and was influenced by them. Upon his return, he withdrew to a wild and beautiful spot in Pontus and devoted himself to prayer and study. When the news of his holiness spread around, many came to him and they took him as a guide to lead them in the way of perfection. In 362 A.D., he was promoted to the priesthood. He continued to teach the believers, to defend the faith, and to save those who had been lost. In 370 A.D., he was ordained Bishop of Caesarea, Cappadocia. For his boldness in truth and for his rebuke of the emperors who conducted themselves against the doctrine and those who behaved immorally. Emperor Valens wanted to exile St. Basil, but he declined because of the death of his son. Another time, when the Emperor wanted to sign an order for his exile, the pen broke in his hand, he took another pen and that also broke, and the same thing happened to a third pen. Valens tore the paper and left the saint to shepherd his flock and manage his church in peace. St. Basil was filled with the Holy Spirit, and wrote the liturgy that is named after him. God wrought by his hands many signs and miracles. Among them, some heretics gained control over one of the churches and decided to close it unless someone opened it by his prayers. By the prayers of this saint, the church was opened and the believers gained access to it once again. Another sign: Abba Ephraim saw a pillar of light between earth and heaven and heard a voice saying, "This is Basil." St. Ephraim came to the city of Caesarea and witnessed the virtues of St. Basil. St. Basil ordained him a deacon. Among his miracles was that a woman wrote all her sins on paper and gave it to St. Basil. He prayed for her and her sins were forgiven, except one sin. He told her to go to Abba Ephraim to pray for her. When she went to Abba Ephraim, he sent her back to St. Basil saying, "Hurry, go back to meet him before his death." When she came back, she found that he had passed away. She wept and she put the paper that she had written on his body and the written sins were blotted out. Also among his miracles was a Jewish physician, who was known for his professional accuracy and who told the saint that he would die after three days. The saint prayed to God, Who prolonged his life, and he did not die on the day that the physician expected him to die. The physician believed and was baptized with all his household. Another example is that of a young man who wrote a covenant with the devil to deny his Christianity and his baptism. Through the prayer of the Saint, the young man was saved from the servitude of the devil(1) . This saint had many virtues and performed many miracles besides the above mentioned ones. He wrote many articles, homilies, and discourses. He put down canons which the believers follow till now. He also wrote commentaries on some of the Books of the Old and New Testaments. His prayers be with us, and Glory be to our God forever and ever. Amen. _______________ (1) The account of the miracle is mentioned under the 13th day of the blessed month of Tute . © 201 CopticChurch.net'

      arabic: في مثل هذا اليوم من سنة 379 م تنيح القديس العظيم الانبا باسيليوس أسقف قيسارية . كان والده ايسيذوروس قسا قديسا ، وقد رزق خمسة أولاد هم باسيليوس وغريغوريوس وكساريون وبطرس ومكرينة . وقد عاش الجميع في القداسة مدي الحياة . وقد تلقي علمي الفصاحة والخطابة علي يد ليبانيوس الفيلسوف الأنطاكي واشتغل بالمحاماة . وفي سنة 358 م هجر العالم وكل أمجاده ، وطاف في براري مصر حيث شاهد النساك وتأثر بهم وعاد فلازم العزلة في إحدى البراري . ولما شاع خبر قداسته التف حوله كثيرون فاتخذوه مرشدا يقودهم في طريق الكمال . وفي سنة 362 م رقي إلى الدرجة الكهنوتية فاستمر يعلم المؤمنين ويدافع عن الإيمان القويم ويرد الضالين وفي سنة 370 م رسم رئسا لأساقفة قيصرية الكبادوك ولكن لجرأته في الحق وتوبيخه الملوك الذين يسلكون ضد العقيدة والآداب أراد الملك نفيه ولكنه أحجم لموت ابنه . ومرة أراد الملك ان يوقع أمرا بنفيه فانكسر القلم فامسك بآخر فانكسر الثاني ايضا وهكذا الثالث فمزق الورقة وترك القديس يرعى شعبه ويدير كنيسته بسلام . وامتلأ باسيليوس من الروح القدس ووضع القداس المشهور المنسوب إليه واجري الله علي يديه عجائب ومعجزات كثيرة . منها ان إحدى الكنائس استولي عليها الهراطقة واتفق الرأي علي غلقها علي ان تعطي لمن يفتحها بصلاته وبصلاة هذا القديس فتحت الكنيسة وتسلمها المؤمنين ثانية . ومنها ايضا:ان مار افرام رأي عمودا من نور من الأرض إلى السماء ولما قال لأخ ان هذا هو باسيليوس آتي إلى قيسارية وشاهد فضائله . وقد رسمه باسيليوس شماسا . ومنها ان امرأة كتبت خطاياها في ورقة وقدمتها للقديس باسيليوس فصلي من اجلها فمحيت خطاياها ما عدا خطية واحدة ، فأمرها ان تمضي إلى الانبا ابرام ليصلي عليها من اجلها ولما مضت إليه أعادها إلى القديس قائلا لها:أسرعي لملاقاته قبل وفاته . فلما عادت وجدته قد انتقل فبكت ووضعت القرطاس علي جسده فمحي ما كان مكتوبا به. ومنها ان طبيبا يهوديا لم يكن ليخطئ في علاجه ، واخبر القديس انه سيموت بعد ثلاثة ايام فصلي إلى الرب فأطال عمره ولم يمت في اليوم الذي حدده فأمن واعتمد هو وأهل بيته . ومنها ان غلاما كتب للشيطان صكا بإنكار مسيحيته ومعموديته وبصلاة القديس باسيليوس عاد الصك وتخلص الغلام من عبودية الشيطان . ولهذا الاب فضائل كثيرة وعجائب عديدة غير هذه وقد وضع ميامر ومقالات ومواعظ ونسكيات وفسر بعض الأسفار من العتيقة والحديثة ووضع قوانين موجودة بين أيدي المؤمنين . صلاته تكون معنا . ولربنا المجد دائما ابديا امين .
