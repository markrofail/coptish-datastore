  - english: Then His brothers and His mother came, and standing outside they sent to Him, calling Him. And a multitude was sitting around Him; and they said to Him, "Look, Your mother and Your brothers are outside seeking You." But He answered them, saying, "Who is My mother, or My brothers?" And He looked around in a circle at those who sat about Him, and said, "Here are My mother and My brothers! For whoever does the will of God is My brother and My sister and mother."
    arabic: 'فجاءت حينئذٍ إخوته وأمه ووقفوا خارجاً وأرسلوا إليه يدعونه وكان الجمع جالساً حوله فقالوا له: هوذا أمك وإخوتك خارجاً يطلبونك فأجابهم: من أمي وإخوتي ثم نظر حوله إلى الجالسين وقال: ها أمي وإخوتي لأن من يصنع مشيئة الله هو أخي وأختي وأمي'
