text:
  - english: Now in the morning, having risen a long while before daylight, He went out and departed to a solitary place; and there He prayed. And Simon and those who were with Him searched for Him. When they found Him, they said to Him, "Everyone is looking for You." But He said to them, "Let us go into the next towns, that I may preach there also, because for this purpose I have come forth." And He was preaching in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and casting out demons.
    arabic: 'وفي الصبح باكراً جداً قام وخرج ومضى إلى موضعٍ خلاءٍ وكان يصلي هناك فتبعه سمعان والذين معه ولما وجدوه قالوا له: إن الجميع يطلبونك فقال لهم: لنذهب إلى القرى المجاورة لأكرز هناك أيضاً لأني لهذا خرجت فكان يكرز في مجامعهم في كل الجليل ويخرج الشياطين'
