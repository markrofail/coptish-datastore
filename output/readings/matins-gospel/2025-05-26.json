    "english": "Then He came to Bethsaida; and they brought a blind man to Him, and begged Him to touch him. So He took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the town. And when He had spit on his eyes and put His hands on him, He asked him if he saw anything. And he looked up and said, \"I see men like trees, walking.\" Then He put His hands on his eyes again and made him look up. And he was restored and saw everyone clearly. Then He sent him away to his house, saying, \"Neither go into the town, nor tell anyone in the town.\"",
    "arabic": "وجاء إلى بيت صيدا فقدموا إليه أعمى وطلبوا إليه أن يلمسه فأخذ بيد الأعمى وأخرجه إلى خارج القرية وتفل في عينيه ووضع يديه عليه وسأله هل أبصر شيئاً فتطلع وقال: أبصر الناس كأشجارٍ يمشون ثم وضع يديه أيضاً على عينيه وجعله يتطلع فعاد صحيحاً وأبصر كل إنسانٍ جلياً فأرسله إلى بيته قائلاً: لا تدخل القرية ولا تقل لأحدٍ في القرية"
