    "english": "Then they brought little children to Him, that He might touch them; but the disciples rebuked those who brought them. But when Jesus saw it, He was greatly displeased and said to them, \"Let the little children come to Me, and do not forbid them; for of such is the kingdom of God. Assuredly, I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God as a little child will by no means enter it.\" And He took them up in His arms, laid His hands on them, and blessed them.",
    "arabic": "وقدموا إليه أولاداً لكي يلمسهم وأما التلاميذ فانتهروا الذين قدموهم فلما رأى يسوع ذلك اغتاظ وقال لهم: دعوا الأولاد يأتون إلي ولا تمنعوهم لأن لمثل هؤلاء ملكوت الله الحق أقول لكم: من لا يقبل ملكوت الله مثل ولدٍ فلن يدخله فاحتضنهم ووضع يديه عليهم وباركهم"
