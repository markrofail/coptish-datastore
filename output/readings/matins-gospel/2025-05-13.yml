  english: Now a leper came to Him, imploring Him, kneeling down to Him and saying to Him, "If You are willing, You can make me clean." Then Jesus, moved with compassion, stretched out His hand and touched him, and said to him, "I am willing; be cleansed." As soon as He had spoken, immediately the leprosy left him, and he was cleansed. And He strictly warned him and sent him away at once, and said to him, "See that you say nothing to anyone; but go your way, show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing those things which Moses commanded, as a testimony to them."
  arabic: 'فأتى إليه أبرص يطلب إليه جاثياً وقائلاً له: إن أردت تقدر أن تطهرني فتحنن يسوع ومد يده ولمسه وقال له: أريد فاطهر فللوقت وهو يتكلم ذهب عنه البرص وطهر فانتهره وأرسله للوقت وقال له: انظر لا تقل لأحدٍ شيئاً بل اذهب أر نفسك للكاهن وقدم عن تطهيرك ما أمر به موسى شهادةً لهم'
