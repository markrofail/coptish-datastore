    "english": "Now it happened as He went to Jerusalem that He passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee. Then as He entered a certain village, there met Him ten men who were lepers, who stood afar off. And they lifted up their voices and said, \"Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!\" So when He saw them, He said to them, \"Go, show yourselves to the priests.\" And so it was that as they went, they were cleansed. And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, returned, and with a loud voice glorified God, and fell down on his face at His feet, giving Him thanks. And he was a Samaritan. So Jesus answered and said, \"Were there not ten cleansed? But where are the nine? Were there not any found who returned to give glory to God except this foreigner?\" And He said to him, \"Arise, go your way. Your faith has made you well.\"",
    "arabic": "وفي ذهابه إلى أورشليم اجتاز في وسط السامرة والجليل وفيما هو داخلٌ إلى قريةٍ استقبله عشرة رجالٍ برصٍ فوقفوا من بعيدٍ وصرخوا: يا يسوع يا معلم ارحمنا فنظر وقال لهم: اذهبوا وأروا أنفسكم للكهنة وفيما هم منطلقون طهروا فواحدٌ منهم لما رأى أنه شفي رجع يمجد الله بصوتٍ عظيمٍ وخر على وجهه عند رجليه شاكراً له وكان سامرياً فقال يسوع: أليس العشرة قد طهروا فأين التسعة ألم يوجد من يرجع ليعطي مجداً لله غير هذا الغريب الجنس ثم قال له: قم وامض إيمانك خلصك"
