    "english": "At Joppa there was a certain disciple named Tabitha, which is translated Dorcas. This woman was full of good works and charitable deeds which she did. But it happened in those days that she became sick and died. When they had washed her, they laid her in an upper room. And since Lydda was near Joppa, and the disciples had heard that Peter was there, they sent two men to him, imploring him not to delay in coming to them. Then Peter arose and went with them. When he had come, they brought him to the upper room. And all the widows stood by him weeping, showing the tunics and garments which Dorcas had made while she was with them. But Peter put them all out, and knelt down and prayed. And turning to the body he said, \"Tabitha, arise.\" And she opened her eyes, and when she saw Peter she sat up. Then he gave her his hand and lifted her up; and when he had called the saints and widows, he presented her alive. And it became known throughout all Joppa, and many believed on the Lord.",
    "arabic": "وكان في يافا تلميذةٌ اسمها طابيثا الذي ترجمته غزالة هذه كانت ممتلئةً أعمالاً صالحةً وإحساناتٍ كانت تعملها وحدث في تلك الأيام أنها مرضت وماتت فغسلوها ووضعوها في عليةٍ وإذ كانت لدة قريبةً من يافا وسمع التلاميذ أن بطرس فيها أرسلوا رجلين يطلبان إليه أن لا يتوانى عن أن يجتاز إليهم فقام بطرس وجاء معهما فلما وصل صعدوا به إلى العلية فوقفت لديه جميع الأرامل يبكين ويرين أقمصةً وثياباً مما كانت تعمل غزالة وهي معهن فأخرج بطرس الجميع خارجاً وجثا على ركبتيه وصلى ثم التفت إلى الجسد وقال: يا طابيثا قومي ففتحت عينيها ولما أبصرت بطرس جلست فناولها يده وأقامها ثم نادى القديسين والأرامل وأحضرها حيةً فصار ذلك معلوماً في يافا كلها فآمن كثيرون بالرب"
