    "english": "Now after many days were past, the Jews plotted to kill him. But their plot became known to Saul. And they watched the gates day and night, to kill him. Then the disciples took him by night and let him down through the wall in a large basket. And when Saul had come to Jerusalem, he tried to join the disciples; but they were all afraid of him, and did not believe that he was a disciple. But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles. And he declared to them how he had seen the Lord on the road, and that He had spoken to him, and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus. So he was with them at Jerusalem, coming in and going out. And he spoke boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus and disputed against the Hellenists, but they attempted to kill him. When the brethren found out, they brought him down to Caesarea and sent him out to Tarsus. Then the churches throughout all Judea, Galilee, and Samaria had peace and were edified. And walking in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, they were multiplied.",
    "arabic": "ولما تمت أيامٌ كثيرةٌ تشاور اليهود ليقتلوه فعلم شاول بمكيدتهم وكانوا يراقبون الأبواب أيضاً نهاراً وليلاً ليقتلوه فأخذه التلاميذ ليلاً وأنزلوه من السور مدلين إياه في سلٍ ولما جاء شاول إلى أورشليم حاول أن يلتصق بالتلاميذ وكان الجميع يخافونه غير مصدقين أنه تلميذٌ فأخذه برنابا وأحضره إلى الرسل وحدثهم كيف أبصر الرب في الطريق وأنه كلمه وكيف جاهر في دمشق باسم يسوع فكان معهم يدخل ويخرج في أورشليم ويجاهر باسم الرب يسوع وكان يخاطب ويباحث اليونانيين فحاولوا أن يقتلوه فلما علم الإخوة أحدروه إلى قيصرية وأرسلوه إلى طرسوس وأما الكنائس في جميع اليهودية والجليل والسامرة فكان لها سلامٌ وكانت تبنى وتسير في خوف الرب وبتعزية الروح القدس كانت تتكاثر"
