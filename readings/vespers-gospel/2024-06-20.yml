  english: Now it happened, on a certain day, that He got into a boat with His
    disciples. And He said to them, "Let us cross over to the other side of the
    lake." And they launched out. But as they sailed He fell asleep. And a
    windstorm came down on the lake, and they were filling with water, and were
    in jeopardy. And they came to Him and awoke Him, saying, "Master, Master, we
    are perishing!" Then He arose and rebuked the wind and the raging of the
    water. And they ceased, and there was a calm. But He said to them, "Where is
    your faith?" And they were afraid, and marveled, saying to one another, "Who
    can this be? For He commands even the winds and water, and they obey Him!"
  arabic: "وفي أحد الأيام دخل سفينةً هو وتلاميذه فقال لهم: لنعبر إلى عبر البحيرة
    فأقلعوا وفيما هم سائرون نام فنزل نوء ريحٍ في البحيرة وكانوا يمتلئون ماءً
    وصاروا في خطرٍ فتقدموا وأيقظوه قائلين: يا معلم يا معلم إننا نهلك فقام وانتهر
    الريح وتموج الماء فانتهيا وصار هدوءٌ ثم قال لهم: أين إيمانكم فخافوا وتعجبوا
    قائلين فيما بينهم: من هو هذا فإنه يأمر الرياح أيضاً والماء فتطيعه"
