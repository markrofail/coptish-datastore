  english: And it happened when He was in a certain city, that behold, a man who
    was full of leprosy saw Jesus; and he fell on his face and implored Him,
    saying, "Lord, if You are willing, You can make me clean." Then He put out
    His hand and touched him, saying, "I am willing; be cleansed." Immediately
    the leprosy left him. And He charged him to tell no one, "But go and show
    yourself to the priest, and make an offering for your cleansing, as a
    testimony to them, just as Moses commanded." However, the report went around
    concerning Him all the more; and great multitudes came together to hear, and
    to be healed by Him of their infirmities. So He Himself often withdrew into
    the wilderness and prayed.
  arabic: "وكان في إحدى المدن فإذا رجلٌ مملوءٌ برصاً فلما رأى يسوع خر على وجهه
    وطلب إليه قائلاً: يا سيد إن أردت تقدر أن تطهرني فمد يده ولمسه قائلاً: أريد
    فاطهر وللوقت ذهب عنه البرص فأوصاه أن لا يقول لأحدٍ بل امض وأر نفسك للكاهن
    وقدم عن تطهيرك كما أمر موسى شهادةً لهم فذاع الخبر عنه أكثر فاجتمع جموعٌ
    كثيرةٌ لكي يسمعوا ويشفوا به من أمراضهم وأما هو فكان يعتزل في البراري ويصلي"
