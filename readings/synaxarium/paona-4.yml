      english: 1. The Martyrdom of St. Shenousi (Sanusi).
      arabic: 1. استشهاد القديس سينوسيوس

      english: On this day, St. Sanusi (Shenousi), who was from Balkim, was martyred.
        When he was a young man, he tended the sheep. He used to give his food
        to the young shepherds, and spend his day fasting. He visited the sick
        and those who were in prison. One night, the angel of the Lord appeared
        to him in a vision and told him, "Rise up, and go before the governor
        and confess your God to receive the crown of martyrdom." When he woke up
        from his sleep, he told that to his mother. She was sorry and wept for
        she was unable to prevent him. He had heard about a righteous holy
        woman, in the city of Shoubra, whose name was Mariam. She received the
        poor and the sojourners and did many good deeds. He went to her, and
        both agreed on receiving the crown of martyrdom. They went to Arsanos,
        the governor, who was residing in a ship anchored on the bank of the
        river Nile. They cried out before him saying, "We are Christians." He
        ordered that they be tortured. While they were torturing them, St.
        Mariam delivered up her soul in the hand of the Lord. The Lord Christ
        comforted and strengthened St. Sanusi. When the Governor failed to
        change his conviction, he sent him with many others to the Governor of
        Ansena (Antinoe), who tortured him severely. Then, he brought a sorcerer
        from Akhmeem, who gave the Saint a drink mixed with poison. The Saint
        having made over it the sign of the Cross, drank it, and no harm came to
        him. When the governor was tired of torturing him, he ordered him put to
        death. They cut off his head with the sword. The sorcerer believed when
        he saw that, so they cut off his head also. Both received the crown of
        martyrdom. May their prayers be with us. Amen.

    text:
      english: On this day also, of the year 136 A.M. (May 29th, 1320 A.D.) Pope
        Yoannis the Eighth (80th Patriarch), departed. He was from Meniat
        Bani-Khosaim, and was known as El Mo'ataman Ebn El-Kedees, and his name
        was Yohanna Ben-Ebsal. He became a monk in the monastery of El-Shahran,
        and was ordained Patriarch on the 19th day of Amshir, 116 A.M. (February
        14th, 1300 A.D.). During his days severe tribulations befell the
        Christians. They forced them to tinge their turbans with the color blue.
        Churches were closed in old Cairo, Cairo, and then in different parts of
        the country except the monasteries in Alexandria, and some churches in
        other cities. An envoy from the king of Spain came to intercede on
        behalf of the Christians. Two churches were opened, one of them was the
        Coptic church of the Virgin Lady in Haret Zeewailah and the other was
        the Malachite church of St. Nicholas in Elhamzawe. He was a contemporary
        of the Saint Anba Barsouma known as El-Erian Ebn-Eltaban, who departed
        during his days. The Patriarch prayed over him on the 5th day of Nasi
        121 A.M. This Patriarch was the last to reside in the church of
        Abu-Saifain in Cairo. He was the first to relocate the patriarchal chair
        to the church of the Virgin Lady in Haret Zeewailah. He was residing
        there in the year 133 A.D. when a severe earthquake took place that
        destroyed a large part of Syria and Egypt. Ebn-kabre indicated that this
        Patriarch had made some changes in the Liturgy. He departed after
        remaining on the chair for twenty years, three months, and fifteen days
        and was buried in the monastery of El-Shahran. May his prayers be with
        us and Glory be to God forever. Amen.
