      english: 1. The Departure of St. Agapetus (Agapius), the Bishop.
      arabic: 1. نياحة القديس اغابيطوس الأسقف
    text:
      english: "On this day St. Agapetus (Agapius), the bishop, departed. He was born
        of Christian parents during the time of the infidel emperors Diocletian
        and Maximianus. His parents brought him up in a Christian upbringing,
        and he was ordained a deacon. Then, he went to one of the monasteries
        and served the elders therein. He learned from them worship and
        asceticism and was accustomed to fasting and prayer. His food was
        legumes to break the fast. He grew in his ascetic life and in every
        virtue, and God wrought through him many miracles, among which were the
        following: He healed a girl from a debilitating sickness which had
        stricken her for a long time, and doctors had failed to cure her. He
        also prayed once and God destroyed a beast which was devouring people.
        By his prayers, God granted healing to many sick people. The news of his
        asceticism, righteousness and the power of his prayer spread everywhere.
        When Lucinus the governor heard about St. Agapius, he brought him by
        force and appointed him a soldier in his army. This did not prevent St.
        Agapius from continuing in his ascetic life and his worship and he
        rather increased in virtue. Shortly after, God perished Diocletian and
        the God-loving Emperor Constantine took over the empire after him. St.
        Agapius desired to gain his freedom and to return to his monastery, and
        God answered him. Emperor Constantine had a servant who was very dear to
        him for the good qualities he had. The servant was stricken with an evil
        spirit which tormented him. Some friends of the Emperor advised him to
        ask Agapius, the soldier, to pray for his servant to be healed. The
        Emperor was surprised to know that one among his soldiers had the gift
        of healing. The Emperor sent for St. Agapius who prayed upon the
        servant, made the sign of the holy cross over him, and God healed him.
        The Emperor rejoiced and wanted to reward him. St. Agapius refused to
        accept any reward except to be granted his release from military service
        to go back to the place of his worship. The Emperor granted him what he
        wanted. The saint returned to where he was before and he lived a
        solitary life. After a while, he was ordained a priest. After the
        departure of the bishop of his town, the people asked for this saint
        from the abbot of the monastery, and he gave him his permission to
        leave. St. Agapius was ordained bishop and shepherded the flock of
        Christ with the best of care. He was granted the gift of prophecy and
        performing miracles. He rebuked the sinners for what they had done in
        secret. He rebuked the priests for forsaking teaching and instructing
        their flocks. His biography included more than one hundred miracles that
        he had performed, and he departed at a good old age. His prayers be with
        us. Amen."
      arabic: هذا اليوم تنيح القديس اغابيطوس الاسقف و قد ولد من ابوين مسيحيين في زمان
        الملكين الوثنيين دقلديانوس و مكسيميانوس ، فربياه تربية مسيحية و قدماه
        شماسا ثم مضي الي احد الاديرة و خدم الشيوخ الذين فيه و تعلم منهم العبادة
        و النسك و تعود المواظبة علي الصوم و الصلاة . و كان غذاؤه بعد الصوم قليلا
        من الترمس و ازداد في نسكه و تقدم في كل فضيلة و اجري الله علي يديه ايات
        كثيرة منها انه شفي صبية اضناها المرض و عجز الاطباء عن علاجها . و صلي مرة
        فاهلك الله وحشا كان يفتك بالناس و بصلات منح الله الشفاء لكثيرين من
        المرضي . فشاع خبر نسكه و فضله و قوة صلاته و سمع بذلك ليكينيوس الوالي
        فاستحضره كرها و عينه جنديا فيم يمنعه هذا من مداومة النسك و العبادة بل
        ازداد في الفضيلة. و بعد قليل اهلك الله دقلديانوس و ملك بعده الملك المحب
        لله قسطنطين الكبير و كان القديس يتمني لو يطلق سراحه و يرجع الي ديره و قد
        اجاب الله امنيته اذ انه كان لقسطنطين الملك غلام عزيز لديه جدا لما عليه
        من الخصال الحميدة و قد اصابه روح نجس كان يعذبه كثيرا فاشار عليه بعض
        اصدقائه إن يلجا الي اغابيطوس ليصلي لاجله فيشفي . فاستغرب إن يكون بين
        الجنود من له هذه الموهبة ، و ارسل الملك في الحال فاستدعاه و صلي علي
        الغلام و رشم عليه علامة الصليب المقدس فشفاه الله . ففرح الملك بذلك و
        اراد مكافاته فلم يقبل الا اطلاقه من الجندية ليعود الي مكان نسكه . فاجابه
        الي طلبه و عاد القديس الي حيث كان اولا و قصد الوحدة و بقي في موضع منفرد
        و بعد زمن رسم قسا. و بعد نياحة اسقف بلده طلبوا هذا القديس من رئيس الدير
        فسمح لهم به فرسم اسقفا و رعي رعية المسيح احسن رعاية و منح نعمة النبوة و
        عمل المعجزات فكان يبكت الخطاة علي ما يعملونه سرا و يوبخ الكهنة علي تركهم
        تعليم الشعب و وعظه . و تضمنت سيرته عمل مائة معجزة ثم تنيح بشيخوخة صالحة
        . صلاته تكون معنا إمين .
