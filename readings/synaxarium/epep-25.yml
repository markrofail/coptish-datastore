          english: 1. On this day, St. Thecla, who was contemporary to St. Paul the
              Apostle, departed. When St. Paul went forth from Antioch and came to the
              city of Nicomedia, there was a certain believer, whose name was Sefaros,
              took him to his house. Many gathered together to hear St. Paul's
              teaching. When this virgin Thecla heard St. Paul's teaching, she looked
              out from the window of her house so that she might hear more of his
              teachings. Her heart was pleased with his teachings, and she followed
              the apostle. Her father and her family were grieved and wanted to
              prevent her from following St. Paul to his meetings. When she did not
              heed their counsel, her father presented her situation to the governor,
              to prevent her from listening to St. Paul's teachings. The governor
              brought the apostle Paul, examined his teachings, and when he could find
              no cause for complaint against him, he shut him up in prison. St. Thecla
              took off her expensive attire and ornaments, and came to St. Paul in
              prison, and bowed down at his feet. When her parents sought her, they
              could not find her. When they found out that she was with St. Paul in
              prison, the Governor ordered to burn her. Her mother cried out saying,
              "Burn her to be an example for the other women of noble families who
              believe in the teaching of the Apostle." They threw her in the fire,
              which did not harm her. She escaped and came to St. Paul, then went to
              Antioch. There, a nobleman saw her, and was captivated with her beauty.
              He asked to marry her, but she refused saying, "I am the pride of
              Christ." He informed the governor of the city about her, who seized her
              and cast her to the lions, which did not harm her for two days. Then she
              came to where St. Paul was, he comforted her, strengthened her and
              commanded her to preach Christ in Iconium. She went there and preached
              the Faith of Christ, and then went to her own city and converted her
              father to the Faith of Christ. Having finished her fight, she departed
              in peace. May her prayers be with us. Amen.

          english: 'This day also marks, the martyrdom of the Saint Abba Isaac, who was
              from Shama, district of Ashmoun. He worked as a gardener and overseer of
              an orchard. He was pious, gentle, and devoted to God. He did not eat
              meat or drink wine. He fasted two days at a time, then broke the fast
              with legumes. He visited the poor and the needy, and gave them what was
              left of his wages. The angel of the Lord appeared to him in a vision and
              commanded him to go to the governor and confess the Name of Christ to
              receive the crown of martyrdom. Abba Isaac rejoiced, distributed all
              that he had, went to the governor, and confessed the Lord Christ. The
              governor tortured him much, but the Lord strengthened and healed him.
              Afterwards, the governor cut off his holy head and he received the crown
              of martyrdom. The people of his hometown came and took his pure body
              with great honor. The Lord wrought many great signs and wonders of his
              holy body. May his prayers be with us. Amen. 3. The Martyrdom of St.
              Hilaria. On this day also, was the martyrdom of St. Hilaria (Liyarya).
              She was born in the city of Demliana which is near by the city of
              Demera, to pious Christian parents. She was chaste, and she fasted and
              prayed continually. When she was twelve years old, the angel of the Lord
              appeared to her while she was working and told her, "Why are you
              sitting here, and the strife is going on and the crown of martyrdom is
              prepared for you." She gave all that she had to the poor and departed
              to Toah, and then to the city of Sarsana, district of El-Shouhada,
              Menoufiah. She located the governor and confessed the Lord Christ before
              him. He tortured her much. St. Shenousy was there. He comforted and
              strengthened her. The governor intensified his torture by making gashes
              in her body with an iron comb, and he drove red-hot iron pegs into her
              ears. Afterwards, he bound her along with seven thousand, six hundred
              martyrs, took them with him and departed. While they were on the ship, a
              crocodile jumped from the water and snatched away an only child from his
              mother, who wept and lamented for her son. This saint had compassion on
              her, and prayed to the Lord Christ. The crocodile returned the child
              alive and sound. When they came to Toah, the governor cast St. Hilaria
              (Liyarya) in the fire which did not harm her. Then they hacked off her
              members, cut off her head and cast them in the fire, thus she received
              the crown of martyrdom. May her prayers be with us. Amen. 4. The
              Martyrdom of Sts. Thecla and Mouji. This day also marks, the martyrdom
              of Sts. Thecla and Mouji (Mugi). They were born in the city of Kerakus,
              and they were brought up by a God-fearing woman, who was a teacher. Once
              when they were crossing the river they saw the governor torturing the
              Christians. They were amazed from his hard-heartedness. The angel of the
              Lord appeared to them, and showed them the glory of the saints. They
              went to Alexandria, where they confessed the Lord Christ before the
              governor, who tortured them severely. Then, he cut off the head of St.
              Mouji. As off St. Thecla, he sent her to the city of Demtaw, where she
              was martyred, after much torture. Thus they received the crown of
              martyrdom. May there prayers be with us. Amen. 5. The Martyrdom of St.
              Antonius (Anthony) of Beba. 5. Today also, St. Antonius (Andona), was
              martyred. He was born in the city of Beba, to pious and merciful
              parents. When he heard about the torture of the martyrs, he went to
              Ansena, and confessed the Lord Christ before the governor. The governor
              ordered him shut to death with arrows. When no harm came upon him, he
              sent him bound with St. Abimachus and two other martyrs to Alexandria.
              The Governor shut up the three in prison and crucified St. Antonius head
              downwards but he was not harmed. When the governor became weary of
              torturing him, he sent him to the governor of Farma. There he found St.
              Mina in prison, and they rejoiced for their meeting. The governor of
              Farma tortured Antonius, at times by combing his body with iron combs,
              and at other times by casting him in a cauldron filled with boiling oil,
              but the Lord strengthened and healed him. Afterwards, they cut off his
              head and thus he received the crown of martyrdom. May his prayers be
              with us. Amen. 6. The Martyrdom of St. Abakragoun. On this day also, St.
              Abakragoun, who was from El-Batanoon, was martyred. He was formerly a
              thief. Two young men plotted with him to steal. They went to the cell of
              a monk, and they found him keeping a vigil, praying. They waited until
              he had finished his prayer and had lain down. Nevertheless, he remained
              standing praying until they became weary and troubled. At dawn, the old
              monk went out to the thieves, and when they saw him they bowed down
              before him, and cast down their swords. He preached to them, taught
              them, and they became monks under his direction. St. Abakragoun fought a
              very great fight, and devoted himself to the ascetic life. The old monk
              prophesied to him that he would receive the crown of martyrdom for the
              Name of Christ, and his saying was fulfilled later on. Six years latter
              the devil incited persecution against the church, St. Abakragoun bid his
              spiritual father farewell and took his blessings. He went to Nakios, and
              confessed the Name of the Lord Christ before the governor, who was
              appointed by Maximianus Caesar. The governor tortured him much and then
              took him to Alexandria. Then he was tortured by hanging him on the mast
              of the ship five times, and each time the ropes broke. Then they placed
              him in a sack made of hide, and threw him into the sea. The angel of the
              Lord brought him out of the water, and commanded him to go to Samanoud.
              On his way he passed by the city of El-Benwan, and its people recognized
              him. They brought to him everyone who had an infirmity and they were
              healed by his prayers. When he arrived at Samanoud, God wrought on his
              hands many signs. He raised, by his prayers, the daughter of Justus the
              Vizier from the dead. Justus, his wife, and all his soldiers, believed,
              and they all received the crown of martyrdom, and they were numbered,
              nine hundred thirty-five men. As for St. Abakragoun, they sent him back
              to Alexandria. After they tortured him with different kinds of tortures,
              they cut off his head, and he received the crown of martyrdom. The angel
              of the Lord appeared to a priest from the city of Menuf, told him about
              the place of the body of the saint, and the priest went and took it.
              After the end of the time of persecution, they built a church in his
              name in the city of El-Batanoon, and placed his body in it. May his
              prayers be with us. Amen. 7. The Martyrdom of St. Domadius El-Souriani
              (The Syrian). This day also, marks the martyrdom of St. Domadius
              El-Souriani (The Syrian). He was brought up in Persia, and learned
              Astrology, and wished to become Christian. One day he found a Persian
              monk in the market, whose name was Aughalis, who taught him the way of
              God and he rejoiced exceedingly. He began to preach to the people of his
              house, and to teach them what might facilitate them to the path of
              Faith. Then he was baptized, and became a monk. He performed many great
              deeds that the brethren were jealous of him. When he felt that, he left
              them and went to the monastery of St. Sergius. There he lived with a
              hermit for ten years during which he did not eat any cooked food. Then
              they ordained him a deacon. While he was ministering with the hermit
              priest in the sanctuary, he saw a white dove of most beautiful
              appearance, which came down and descended upon the altar. Domadius
              thought that it was a real dove, so he made a motion with his hand to
              drive the dove off, for he was worried about the content of the chalice.
              After the service was ended, the priest asked him, "What did disturb
              you during the liturgy?" Domadius told him what he had seen. The priest
              told him, "If you see the dove again tell me." In the next day, the
              priest went up to the altar to celebrate the liturgy as usual, and when
              Domadius saw the dove, he told the priest, "My father the dove has
              come." The priest looked around but he could not see anything. He bowed
              his head before God with weeping and prayer by day and night for a
              period of time, until he was worthy to see this dove. He realized that
              this was the sign of the Holy Spirit. He did not say anything to St.
              Domadius lest pride fill his heart, but he told the bishop who had
              ordained him a priest. When the news of his holiness reached the
              patriarch of this area, he wished to visit him. When St. Domadius knew
              of this, he fled from there and came to the church of St. Cosmas, where
              he lived for a while nearby, feeding on the vegetation of the earth. God
              wrought on his hand many signs and miracles. When Emperor Julian went
              out to fight against the Persians, he passed by the cave of this saint.
              They told him about the saint, so he ordered him stoned. The soldiers
              stoned him and his disciple, until a great heap of stones stood over the
              cave. Many years later, God revealed his body, a church was built for
              him and God manifested many wonders in it. May his prayers be with us.
              Amen. 8. The Consecration of the Church of St. Mercurius. Today also the
              church celebrates the commemoration of the consecration of the church of
              the great St. Mercurius Abu-Saifain. The biography of his life is
              written under the twenty- fifth day of the month of Hatour. May his
              blessing be with us. Amen. 9. The Departure of St. Palamon, the Father
              of the Monks. On this day also, of the year 316 A.M., the saint Anba
              Palamon the anchorite, departed. He was an anchorite in the Eastern
              Mount in a town called El-Kasre and El-Sayad, district of Nagaa-Hammady,
              governorate of Quena. The Devil was weary of tempting this father, and
              failed to overcome him. The Devil took every chance to direct his snares
              against him. One day, the man of God Anba Palamon rose up, took the work
              of his hand, and walked toward the countryside of Egypt. While he was
              walking in his way, he was weeping for his sins. The enemy of the good
              led him astray in the mountain, for seven days, until he was close to
              death from hunger and thirst, for it was summer. Finally, he collapsed,
              fell on the ground, wishing to die. God, the lover of mankind, wished
              not to leave His servant Anba Palamon fall prey to the devil, so He
              ordered the devil to leave him. When the old man realized that, he cried
              saying, "O Lord Jesus Christ help me." Instantly he heard a voice
              saying to him, "Do not be afraid, for the enemy can not overcome you.
              Rise and walk a short distance to the south. You shall find a righteous
              old monk whose name is Talasoun. Tell him about all that the devil has
              brought on you, and the grievous sin that he tempted you with in your
              young age. He will pray on your behalf so that your sins will be
              forgiven." The blessed Anba Palamon rose up, carried the works of his
              hands, and walked in the mount reciting Psalm fifty four, "Save me, O
              God, by Your name, And vindicate me by Your strength. Hear my prayer, O
              God; Give ear to the words of my mouth. For strangers have risen up
              against me, And oppressors have sought after my life; They have not set
              God before them. Behold, God is my helper; The Lord is with those who
              uphold my life. He will repay my enemies for their evil. Cut them off in
              Your truth. I will freely sacrifice to You; I will praise Your name, O
              LORD, for it is good. For He has delivered me out of all trouble; And my
              eye has seen its desire upon my enemies." He also recited Psalms 68,
              "Let God arise, Let His enemies be scattered; Let those also who hate
              Him flee before Him. As smoke is driven away, So drive them away; As wax
              melts before the fire, So let the wicked perish at the presence of God.
              But let the righteous be glad; Let them rejoice before God; Yes, let
              them rejoice exceedingly." He did not cease praying until God guided
              him to the place of Anba Talasoun. When Anba Talasoun saw him, he
              rejoiced exceedingly, greeted him, held his hand and pulled him up the
              rock where he lived. They prayed, then sat down talking about the
              greatness of God. Anba Talasoun asked Anba Palamon about how he found
              his way to come to visit him in this wilderness. Then Anba Palamon
              started crying and kneeled, saying, "Please forgive me O my beloved
              holy father." Anba Talasoun said, "The Lord Jesus Christ forgives to
              all of us all our transgressions." Anba Palamon replied saying, "I am
              ashamed to tell you, O my holy father, about the enormous sin that
              befell me by the Devil without knowing." Anba Talasoun told him, "It
              is written ''Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for
              another, that you may be healed.''" When Anba Palamon saw that the
              blessed Anba Talasoun was comforting and encouraging him, he started to
              tell him, "While I was living in the monastery, I asked God to forgive
              me my sins. I also read in the holy books of the fathers which are
              inspired by the Spirit of God, that solitary life brings forth the fear
              of God, and God despises mockery and laughing for no reason. So I
              decided to live a solitary life in my small home, to not talk to anyone,
              and never to laugh, but to cry on my sins by day and night. The Devil
              often fought against me. He tried to please my heart with laughter but I
              did not heed him, and I never cursed. I fought for a long time through
              these tribulations, steadfast in the salvation of our Lord Christ until
              the enemy was wrath with me. One day I took the work of my hands, walked
              in the mount to go to sell it and buy a little of bread. After I was at
              a considerable distance from my abode, the Devil captivated me, and
              right away I lost my mind. He removed the Name of God from my mouth and
              I was no longer reciting the Divine sayings. The mount changed entirely
              before me, the sandy earth became black. When I looked before me I saw a
              new city, had splendid buildings, magnificent houses, rich palaces, and
              the city had shining armored gat which was fortified as a city of a
              king, surrounded by trees and gardens. When I saw it, I wondered about
              this city and its great distinction."When I inclined to enter the city
              thinking that its people might buy from me the work of my hands. As I
              came close to the walls of the city, I found a turning water wheel
              (sakieh), and I saw a sorrowful woman. Her face was very gloomy. Her
              clothes were torn and her veil covered her eyes for the sake of decency.
              She was standing beside the well, running the water wheel and watering
              the vines. When she saw me, she sat down, covered her head and said,
              ''Bless me O my holy father.'' In hast she put down the baskets before me
              then said, ''Sit down and rest O my beloved father for you had become
              tired from what you have carried.'' She sat me down beside running water,
              she took water in her hands, poured it on my feet, and washed them as
              someone taking blessings. She acted as a woman of a rich man. I asked
              her, ''O faithful woman, tell me, if I enter this city with the work of
              my hands would I find one who would buy it from me?'' She said, ''Yes,
              they would buy it from you. Nevertheless, leave it and I will buy it
              from you, and I will give you all that you need. For I was married to a
              rich man who died recently and left me much money and herds of cattle. I
              pick the fruits of these enormous vines, and I do not have anyone to
              oversee it. I wish to have a man like you, to whom I can hand all my
              possessions, to handle the way he sees fit. So if you accept, O my holy
              father, to come and oversee my house and to take charge of all my
              possessions, I will take you as a husband.'' I replied, ''If the monk gets
              married, shame and disgrace follow him.'' Then the woman told me, ''If you
              do not take me as a wife, be an overseer for my possessions. You
              supervise it during the day, for I own fields, cattle, barns, vineyards,
              slaves and maiden servants, and when the night falls you shall fulfill
              your prayers.'' Then she rose up, and took me to her house. She prepared
              a table of different kinds of foods and placed it before me. Afterwards,
              she went to her room, and put on expensive and extravagant clothes, then
              came and embraced me. I was surprised and I held fast to the power of
              God almighty, and crossed myself with the sign of the cross. All that I
              saw immediately vanished as the smoke before the winds, and nothing of
              what this woman did remained. "Instantly, I realized that all of this
              was the doing of the Devil who wished to make me fall in sin. I cried
              bitterly, and regretted much what I had done. The Lord had compassion on
              me with His tender mercy, and sent me His angel who comforted me, and
              promised the forgiveness of my sins and told me, ''Go to the saint Anba
              Talasoun who is nearby you, and confess to him your sins. Tell him that
              you have come to him so that the Lord may forgive your sins through his
              prayers.''" The saint Anba Talasoun prayed saying, "O my son may the
              Lord forgive you and myself." Subsequently, a table came down from
              heaven, they ate, then Anba Palamon returned to his place of worship in
              peace. This Saint received the gift of healing from God. The beasts were
              friendly to him, he fed them by his hands, and they licked his feet. He
              lived naked, so God lengthened his hair until it covered his whole body.
              He fasted the whole week, only ate on Saturday and Sunday. He ate a half
              loaf of bread that God sent him with the raven. Often he ate from the
              vegetation of the mount. He was merciful, compassionate, and tender like
              His creator. When the night fell, he went down from his place of
              worship, to visit the prisoners, orphans, widowers, those in trouble,
              and the sojourners, as his strength allowed him, to help them from the
              price of the works of his hands. St. Palamon was fervent in his
              asceticism and worship. He persevered, all the days of his life, in the
              daily and nightly prayers, and watching all night in ascetic worships.
              St. Pachomius17, the father of the monastic cenobite, was the disciple
              of this saint. When St. Pachomius18 rejected paganism and adopted
              Christianity, he wished to live a life of asceticism and worship, so the
              priest of his hometown directed him to go to the great hermit Anba
              Palamon. Pachomius handed the care for the poor and the needy in his
              town to another elder monk, and went to Anba Palamon. When he arrived,
              he knocked the door of his cell. The old man looked from an aperture and
              asked him, "Who are you O brother? and what do you want?" Pachomius
              answered hastily, "I, O blessed father, looking for the Christ the God
              Whom you do worship, and I beg your fatherhood to accept me and to make
              me a monk." Abba Palamon told him, "O my son, monasticism is not an
              unrestricted labor, and the man does not come into it as he pleases, for
              many had adopted it not knowing its hardships, and when they adopted it
              they could not endure it, and you have heard about it without knowing
              its contention." Pachomius replied, "Do not turn my request, and my
              desire, and do not put off the flame of my zeal. Accept me, be patient
              with me, and examine me, and afterward do whatever you see fit with
              me." The old man told him, "Go, O my son test your self alone for a
              period of time, then come back to me for I am willing to labor with you
              as much as my weakness allows so you might know your own self. The
              monastic piety needs toughness and asceticism, and I will teach you
              first its extent. Then you go and examine your self if you could endure
              the matter or not. My intent in that, God knows, is for the sake of your
              teaching and discipline and not for any other reason. When we, O my
              beloved son, knew the vanity and trickery of this world, we came to this
              distant place, and carried on our shoulders the cross of our Christ, not
              the wooden rod, but the overcoming of the flesh, subduing its lusts, and
              wasting its power. We spent the night praying and glorifying God. Often
              we vigil from sun set till the morning praying and working much with our
              hands, making either ropes, braid palm fibers, weave palm leaves or hair
              to resist sleep and to have what our bodies need and to feed the poor as
              the apostle said, ''remember the needy.'' We entirely do not know the
              eating of oil, cooked food or drinking liquors. We fast till the evening
              of the summer days, and two days at a time during the winter then we
              break the fast by eating only bread and salt. We keep away the boredom
              by remembering death, and how close it is. We refute every pride and
              exaltation and guard ourselves from evil thoughts by humility and piety.
              By this ascetic strive that is accomplished by the grace of God, we
              offer our souls a living sacrifice, acceptable to God, not only once but
              many times. For according to the strive and how much we exert ourselves
              in it, we realize spiritual gifts, remembering the saying of the Lord,
              "Those overcame themselves, seize the Kingdom of Heaven." When
              Pachomius heard from Abba Palamon these sayings that he never heard
              before, he was more assured by the spirit, and was encouraged on facing
              the hardships and endure the pains. He replied saying, "I am confident
              in the Lord Christ first, and by the support of your prayers second, I
              would be able to fulfill all the precepts, and persevere with you till
              death." Pachomius then kneeled before him and kissed his hand. The old
              man preached him and instructed him about the importance of mortifying
              the flesh, the humility and contrition of the heart. He told him, "If
              you kept what I told you, did not go back, or vacillate between two
              opinions, we will rejoice with you." Then he told him, "Do you think
              my son that by all what I mentioned to you from asceticism, praying,
              watching and fasting we ask for the glory of men, no my son, it is not
              like that. We lead you to the works of salvation so we would be
              blameless, for it is written every apparent thing is light, and we must
              through many tribulations enter the kingdom of heaven. Now go back to
              your abode so you might examine your self and test her for few days for
              what you are asking is not an easy task." Pachomius answered him
              saying, "I have examined myself in every thing, and I hope with the
              Grace of God and your holy prayers, that your heart would be pleased
              toward me." The old man answered, "Well." Anba Palamon accepted him
              with joy, then left him for ten days testing him in prayer, watching and
              fasting. Three month later and after he tested his patience, endurance,
              strife and will, he prayed over him, clipped off his hair, and put on
              him the garb of the monks (El-Eskeem) in year 34 A.D. They persevered
              together on asceticism and prayer as they worked in their spare times in
              weaving hair and knitting clothes to gain their bare necessities, and
              what they spared they gave to the needy. Whenever they were vigilance
              and the sleep overcame them, they went out their cells and moved sand
              from one place to another to exhaust their bodies and remove the sleep
              away from them. The old man went on preaching the young man and
              encouraging him saying, "Be courageous O Pachomius, let your devotion
              to God always be flamed with the fire of love, and be before Him, in
              fear, humility, and persevering in praying and kneeling without boredom.
              Be watchful lest the tempter examine you and grief you." It came in the
              biography of St. Pachomius in a manuscript in the monastery of
              El-Baramous the following: One day someone knocked on the door of Sts.
              Palamon and Pachomius to visit them, and he spent the night with them.
              The pride and self-reliance had overcome that person. While they were
              talking about the words of God and before them was fire, for it was
              winter, the guest told them, "Whoever of you has strong faith in God,
              let him rise up, stand on this blazing embers, and recite the prayer
              which the Lord had taught to His disciples." When the old man St.
              Palamon heard that, he admonished him saying, "Cursed is the defiled
              devil who planted this thought in your heart. so stop talking." The
              guest did not head to the words of the old man and said, "I, I would."
              He rose up and stood on the blazing coal while saying the Lord''s prayer
              slowly. Then he stepped out the fire which did not touch his body with
              any harm, and went to his abode with arrogance. Pachomius told Anba
              Palamon, "God knows that I marveled about this brother who stood on the
              amber and his feet did not burn." The old man replied saying, "Do not
              be amazed for there is no doubt that this from the work of the Devil.
              The Lord had allowed his feet not to be burned as it is written to the
              crooked, God sends crooked ways. Believe me O my son, if you know the
              torment that is prepared for him, you will be weeping for his
              wretchedness." The Devil came to this man in the form of a woman and
              enticed him to allow her to enter his cell. Because of the pride and the
              blindness of his perception, he did not realize the danger that
              surrounded him. The lust filled his heart toward her, and immediately
              the devil struck and threw him on the ground and he remained as a dead
              man for a day. When he regained his conscious and his faculties, he went
              to Abba Palamon weeping and remorseful for what he had done. He asked
              for their help and prayers for the devil had captivated him by his own
              free will. While he was talking to them, the old man and his disciple
              were weeping, the evil spirit suddenly came over him. He went to the
              mountain, and he lost his mind. He was astray for a period of time, then
              he threw himself in a fire which burned him. When the old man knew that,
              he was grieved. His disciple asked him, "How God allowed this to happen
              to him after he confessed and asked for repentance with tears and
              remorse." The Abba answered, "God with His foreknowledge knew that the
              repentance of this brother was not sincere, so He allowed him to reap
              what he did." While St. Pachomius was still staying with his teacher
              Anba Palamon, one day he was wondering in the wilderness, and he came to
              the village of Tabanseen. When he was praying, the angel of the Lord
              appeared and told him, "O Pachomius, with the order of the Lord, build
              a monastery in the spot that your are standing on, hence many will come
              to you seeking monasticism." He returned to the old man Anba Palamon
              and told him what the angel had told him, and his intention of
              fulfilling the Will of God. Anba Palamon was sad for the departure of
              his disciple and said, "How could you leave me after seven years you
              spent with me in obedience and submission and I am an old man. I see
              that it is easier on me to accompany you than you leaving me." They
              moved south until they came to Tabanseen, and started to build a
              monastery. That was in the year 311 A.D., and Pachomius was thirty years
              old. When they finished building the monastery, Anba Palamon told his
              disciple Pachomius, "My beloved son I long to return to my cell and the
              place of my solitude. I had known that God had appointed you to
              establish this monastery, which will grow and be filled with God
              pleasing monks. You shall receive power and long suffering to manage
              them. As of my self, I have became old, weak, and the time of my
              departure had drew near. So I see that my solitary life is best for me.
              Nevertheless, I ask from your kindness that you do not deprive me from
              seeing you from now and then. I shall come to visit you as the few days
              left for me allow." They were separated after they prayed with each
              other, and they visited each other. In one of the visits of Anba
              Palamon, he became ill and departed to the Lord that he served and loved
              since his young age. Anba Pachomius took the blessings of his teacher,
              shrouded and buried him. Many wonders and miracles have been attributed
              to this saint. An ancient church in his name is located in the town of
              El-Kasre and El-Sayad in a monastery named after him which had other
              churches in the name of the Virgin St. Mary, the archangel Michael, St.
              Mercurius Abu-Saifain, and St. Demianah. A great festival celebration is
              celebrated annually in his feast day. May his prayers be with us and
              Glory be to God forever. Amen. _________________________________________
              17 The biography of St. Pachomius is under the fourteenth day of Bashans
              (Vol. III, P. 430). 18 When Constantine the Great was victorious,
              Pachomius'' military detachment returned to its post in Upper Egypt, and
              the soldiers were released to return to their hometown. St. Pachomius
              arrived to his town Chinu, and met its priest and asked him to join him
              to the congregation of his church. Since Pachomius was pagan as his
              parents, the priest wrote his name among the catechumens, but God
              inspired the priest to accept him among the believers. He baptized him
              in Maundy thursday, year 31 A.D., and he was twenty years old. He grew
              in virtues, ministering to the believers, and loving the people, until
              his merits became well known. Many people gathered around him. When an
              epidemic spread in this village, he served them, and brought them wood
              from far distances. The Lord had mercy on him and saved him from the
              epidemic, and remained three years visiting the orphans, and the widows,
              ministering to their needs, keeping himself from the defilement of the
              world.'

              أنه لما خرج بولس من إنطاكية وأتي إلى ايقونية أن أخذه رجل مؤمن اسمه
              سيفاروس إلى بيته . فاجتمعت اليه جموع كثيرة ليسمعوا تعليمه . ولما سمعت به
              العذراء تكلة تطلعت من الطاقة لتسمع تعاليمه فطاب قلبها لذلك وتبعت الرسول
              فحزن أبوها وكل ذويها وأرادوا منعها من متابعة بولس في اجتماعاته . وإذ لم
              تذعن لرأيهم عرض أبوها أمرها علي الوالي ليمنعها من سماع تعاليم بولس.
              فاستحضر الوالي بولس الرسول وفحص تعاليمه وإذ لم يتمكن من إيجاد علة عليه
              اعتقله أما تكلة فنزعت عنها أفخر ملابسها وحليها ولبست ثياب العبيد ، وأتت
              إلى القديس بولس في السجن وخرت عند قدميه فلما طلبوها لم يجدوها وعرفوا

          english: 3. The Martyrdom of St. Hilaria.
          arabic: 3. استشهاد القديستين تكلة وموجي
      text:
          english: 'On this day also, was the martyrdom of St. Hilaria (Liyarya). She was
              born in the city of Demliana which is near by the city of Demera, to
              pious Christian parents. She was chaste, and she fasted and prayed
              continually. When she was twelve years old, the angel of the Lord
              appeared to her while she was working and told her, "Why are you
              sitting here, and the strife is going on and the crown of martyrdom is
              prepared for you." She gave all that she had to the poor and departed
              to Toah, and then to the city of Sarsana, district of El-Shouhada,
              Menoufiah. She located the governor and confessed the Lord Christ before
              him. He tortured her much. St. Shenousy was there. He comforted and
              strengthened her. The governor intensified his torture by making gashes
              in her body with an iron comb, and he drove red-hot iron pegs into her
              ears. Afterwards, he bound her along with seven thousand, six hundred
              martyrs, took them with him and departed. While they were on the ship, a
              crocodile jumped from the water and snatched away an only child from his
              mother, who wept and lamented for her son. This saint had compassion on
              her, and prayed to the Lord Christ. The crocodile returned the child
              alive and sound. When they came to Toah, the governor cast St. Hilaria
              (Liyarya) in the fire which did not harm her. Then they hacked off her
              members, cut off her head and cast them in the fire, thus she received
              the crown of martyrdom. May her prayers be with us. Amen. 4. The
              Martyrdom of Sts. Thecla and Mouji. This day also marks, the martyrdom
              of Sts. Thecla and Mouji (Mugi). They were born in the city of Kerakus,
              and they were brought up by a God-fearing woman, who was a teacher. Once
              when they were crossing the river they saw the governor torturing the
              Christians. They were amazed from his hard-heartedness. The angel of the
              Lord appeared to them, and showed them the glory of the saints. They
              went to Alexandria, where they confessed the Lord Christ before the
              governor, who tortured them severely. Then, he cut off the head of St.
              Mouji. As off St. Thecla, he sent her to the city of Demtaw, where she
              was martyred, after much torture. Thus they received the crown of
              martyrdom. May there prayers be with us. Amen. 5. The Martyrdom of St.
              Antonius (Anthony) of Beba. 5. Today also, St. Antonius (Andona), was
              martyred. He was born in the city of Beba, to pious and merciful
              parents. When he heard about the torture of the martyrs, he went to
              Ansena, and confessed the Lord Christ before the governor. The governor
              ordered him shut to death with arrows. When no harm came upon him, he
              sent him bound with St. Abimachus and two other martyrs to Alexandria.
              The Governor shut up the three in prison and crucified St. Antonius head
              downwards but he was not harmed. When the governor became weary of
              torturing him, he sent him to the governor of Farma. There he found St.
              Mina in prison, and they rejoiced for their meeting. The governor of
              Farma tortured Antonius, at times by combing his body with iron combs,
              and at other times by casting him in a cauldron filled with boiling oil,
              but the Lord strengthened and healed him. Afterwards, they cut off his
              head and thus he received the crown of martyrdom. May his prayers be
              with us. Amen. 6. The Martyrdom of St. Abakragoun. On this day also, St.
              Abakragoun, who was from El-Batanoon, was martyred. He was formerly a
              thief. Two young men plotted with him to steal. They went to the cell of
              a monk, and they found him keeping a vigil, praying. They waited until
              he had finished his prayer and had lain down. Nevertheless, he remained
              standing praying until they became weary and troubled. At dawn, the old
              monk went out to the thieves, and when they saw him they bowed down
              before him, and cast down their swords. He preached to them, taught
              them, and they became monks under his direction. St. Abakragoun fought a
              very great fight, and devoted himself to the ascetic life. The old monk
              prophesied to him that he would receive the crown of martyrdom for the
              Name of Christ, and his saying was fulfilled later on. Six years latter
              the devil incited persecution against the church, St. Abakragoun bid his
              spiritual father farewell and took his blessings. He went to Nakios, and
              confessed the Name of the Lord Christ before the governor, who was
              appointed by Maximianus Caesar. The governor tortured him much and then
              took him to Alexandria. Then he was tortured by hanging him on the mast
              of the ship five times, and each time the ropes broke. Then they placed
              him in a sack made of hide, and threw him into the sea. The angel of the
              Lord brought him out of the water, and commanded him to go to Samanoud.
              On his way he passed by the city of El-Benwan, and its people recognized
              him. They brought to him everyone who had an infirmity and they were
              healed by his prayers. When he arrived at Samanoud, God wrought on his
              hands many signs. He raised, by his prayers, the daughter of Justus the
              Vizier from the dead. Justus, his wife, and all his soldiers, believed,
              and they all received the crown of martyrdom, and they were numbered,
              nine hundred thirty-five men. As for St. Abakragoun, they sent him back
              to Alexandria. After they tortured him with different kinds of tortures,
              they cut off his head, and he received the crown of martyrdom. The angel
              of the Lord appeared to a priest from the city of Menuf, told him about
              the place of the body of the saint, and the priest went and took it.
              After the end of the time of persecution, they built a church in his
              name in the city of El-Batanoon, and placed his body in it. May his
              prayers be with us. Amen. 7. The Martyrdom of St. Domadius El-Souriani
              (The Syrian). This day also, marks the martyrdom of St. Domadius
              El-Souriani (The Syrian). He was brought up in Persia, and learned
              Astrology, and wished to become Christian. One day he found a Persian
              monk in the market, whose name was Aughalis, who taught him the way of
              God and he rejoiced exceedingly. He began to preach to the people of his
              house, and to teach them what might facilitate them to the path of
              Faith. Then he was baptized, and became a monk. He performed many great
              deeds that the brethren were jealous of him. When he felt that, he left
              them and went to the monastery of St. Sergius. There he lived with a
              hermit for ten years during which he did not eat any cooked food. Then
              they ordained him a deacon. While he was ministering with the hermit
              priest in the sanctuary, he saw a white dove of most beautiful
              appearance, which came down and descended upon the altar. Domadius
              thought that it was a real dove, so he made a motion with his hand to
              drive the dove off, for he was worried about the content of the chalice.
              After the service was ended, the priest asked him, "What did disturb
              you during the liturgy?" Domadius told him what he had seen. The priest
              told him, "If you see the dove again tell me." In the next day, the
              priest went up to the altar to celebrate the liturgy as usual, and when
              Domadius saw the dove, he told the priest, "My father the dove has
              come." The priest looked around but he could not see anything. He bowed
              his head before God with weeping and prayer by day and night for a
              period of time, until he was worthy to see this dove. He realized that
              this was the sign of the Holy Spirit. He did not say anything to St.
              Domadius lest pride fill his heart, but he told the bishop who had
              ordained him a priest. When the news of his holiness reached the
              patriarch of this area, he wished to visit him. When St. Domadius knew
              of this, he fled from there and came to the church of St. Cosmas, where
              he lived for a while nearby, feeding on the vegetation of the earth. God
              wrought on his hand many signs and miracles. When Emperor Julian went
              out to fight against the Persians, he passed by the cave of this saint.
              They told him about the saint, so he ordered him stoned. The soldiers
              stoned him and his disciple, until a great heap of stones stood over the
              cave. Many years later, God revealed his body, a church was built for
              him and God manifested many wonders in it. May his prayers be with us.
              Amen. 8. The Consecration of the Church of St. Mercurius. Today also the
              church celebrates the commemoration of the consecration of the church of
              the great St. Mercurius Abu-Saifain. The biography of his life is
              written under the twenty- fifth day of the month of Hatour. May his
              blessing be with us. Amen. 9. The Departure of St. Palamon, the Father
              of the Monks. On this day also, of the year 316 A.M., the saint Anba
              Palamon the anchorite, departed. He was an anchorite in the Eastern
              Mount in a town called El-Kasre and El-Sayad, district of Nagaa-Hammady,
              governorate of Quena. The Devil was weary of tempting this father, and
              failed to overcome him. The Devil took every chance to direct his snares
              against him. One day, the man of God Anba Palamon rose up, took the work
              of his hand, and walked toward the countryside of Egypt. While he was
              walking in his way, he was weeping for his sins. The enemy of the good
              led him astray in the mountain, for seven days, until he was close to
              death from hunger and thirst, for it was summer. Finally, he collapsed,
              fell on the ground, wishing to die. God, the lover of mankind, wished
              not to leave His servant Anba Palamon fall prey to the devil, so He
              ordered the devil to leave him. When the old man realized that, he cried
              saying, "O Lord Jesus Christ help me." Instantly he heard a voice
              saying to him, "Do not be afraid, for the enemy can not overcome you.
              Rise and walk a short distance to the south. You shall find a righteous
              old monk whose name is Talasoun. Tell him about all that the devil has
              brought on you, and the grievous sin that he tempted you with in your
              young age. He will pray on your behalf so that your sins will be
              forgiven." The blessed Anba Palamon rose up, carried the works of his
              hands, and walked in the mount reciting Psalm fifty four, "Save me, O
              God, by Your name, And vindicate me by Your strength. Hear my prayer, O
              God; Give ear to the words of my mouth. For strangers have risen up
              against me, And oppressors have sought after my life; They have not set
              God before them. Behold, God is my helper; The Lord is with those who
              uphold my life. He will repay my enemies for their evil. Cut them off in
              Your truth. I will freely sacrifice to You; I will praise Your name, O
              LORD, for it is good. For He has delivered me out of all trouble; And my
              eye has seen its desire upon my enemies." He also recited Psalms 68,
              "Let God arise, Let His enemies be scattered; Let those also who hate
              Him flee before Him. As smoke is driven away, So drive them away; As wax
              melts before the fire, So let the wicked perish at the presence of God.
              But let the righteous be glad; Let them rejoice before God; Yes, let
              them rejoice exceedingly." He did not cease praying until God guided
              him to the place of Anba Talasoun. When Anba Talasoun saw him, he
              rejoiced exceedingly, greeted him, held his hand and pulled him up the
              rock where he lived. They prayed, then sat down talking about the
              greatness of God. Anba Talasoun asked Anba Palamon about how he found
              his way to come to visit him in this wilderness. Then Anba Palamon
              started crying and kneeled, saying, "Please forgive me O my beloved
              holy father." Anba Talasoun said, "The Lord Jesus Christ forgives to
              all of us all our transgressions." Anba Palamon replied saying, "I am
              ashamed to tell you, O my holy father, about the enormous sin that
              befell me by the Devil without knowing." Anba Talasoun told him, "It
              is written ''Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for
              another, that you may be healed.''" When Anba Palamon saw that the
              blessed Anba Talasoun was comforting and encouraging him, he started to
              tell him, "While I was living in the monastery, I asked God to forgive
              me my sins. I also read in the holy books of the fathers which are
              inspired by the Spirit of God, that solitary life brings forth the fear
              of God, and God despises mockery and laughing for no reason. So I
              decided to live a solitary life in my small home, to not talk to anyone,
              and never to laugh, but to cry on my sins by day and night. The Devil
              often fought against me. He tried to please my heart with laughter but I
              did not heed him, and I never cursed. I fought for a long time through
              these tribulations, steadfast in the salvation of our Lord Christ until
              the enemy was wrath with me. One day I took the work of my hands, walked
              in the mount to go to sell it and buy a little of bread. After I was at
              a considerable distance from my abode, the Devil captivated me, and
              right away I lost my mind. He removed the Name of God from my mouth and
              I was no longer reciting the Divine sayings. The mount changed entirely
              before me, the sandy earth became black. When I looked before me I saw a
              new city, had splendid buildings, magnificent houses, rich palaces, and
              the city had shining armored gat which was fortified as a city of a
              king, surrounded by trees and gardens. When I saw it, I wondered about
              this city and its great distinction."When I inclined to enter the city
              thinking that its people might buy from me the work of my hands. As I
              came close to the walls of the city, I found a turning water wheel
              (sakieh), and I saw a sorrowful woman. Her face was very gloomy. Her
              clothes were torn and her veil covered her eyes for the sake of decency.
              She was standing beside the well, running the water wheel and watering
              the vines. When she saw me, she sat down, covered her head and said,
              ''Bless me O my holy father.'' In hast she put down the baskets before me
              then said, ''Sit down and rest O my beloved father for you had become
              tired from what you have carried.'' She sat me down beside running water,
              she took water in her hands, poured it on my feet, and washed them as
              someone taking blessings. She acted as a woman of a rich man. I asked
              her, ''O faithful woman, tell me, if I enter this city with the work of
              my hands would I find one who would buy it from me?'' She said, ''Yes,
              they would buy it from you. Nevertheless, leave it and I will buy it
              from you, and I will give you all that you need. For I was married to a
              rich man who died recently and left me much money and herds of cattle. I
              pick the fruits of these enormous vines, and I do not have anyone to
              oversee it. I wish to have a man like you, to whom I can hand all my
              possessions, to handle the way he sees fit. So if you accept, O my holy
              father, to come and oversee my house and to take charge of all my
              possessions, I will take you as a husband.'' I replied, ''If the monk gets
              married, shame and disgrace follow him.'' Then the woman told me, ''If you
              do not take me as a wife, be an overseer for my possessions. You
              supervise it during the day, for I own fields, cattle, barns, vineyards,
              slaves and maiden servants, and when the night falls you shall fulfill
              your prayers.'' Then she rose up, and took me to her house. She prepared
              a table of different kinds of foods and placed it before me. Afterwards,
              she went to her room, and put on expensive and extravagant clothes, then
              came and embraced me. I was surprised and I held fast to the power of
              God almighty, and crossed myself with the sign of the cross. All that I
              saw immediately vanished as the smoke before the winds, and nothing of
              what this woman did remained. "Instantly, I realized that all of this
              was the doing of the Devil who wished to make me fall in sin. I cried
              bitterly, and regretted much what I had done. The Lord had compassion on
              me with His tender mercy, and sent me His angel who comforted me, and
              promised the forgiveness of my sins and told me, ''Go to the saint Anba
              Talasoun who is nearby you, and confess to him your sins. Tell him that
              you have come to him so that the Lord may forgive your sins through his
              prayers.''" The saint Anba Talasoun prayed saying, "O my son may the
              Lord forgive you and myself." Subsequently, a table came down from
              heaven, they ate, then Anba Palamon returned to his place of worship in
              peace. This Saint received the gift of healing from God. The beasts were
              friendly to him, he fed them by his hands, and they licked his feet. He
              lived naked, so God lengthened his hair until it covered his whole body.
              He fasted the whole week, only ate on Saturday and Sunday. He ate a half
              loaf of bread that God sent him with the raven. Often he ate from the
              vegetation of the mount. He was merciful, compassionate, and tender like
              His creator. When the night fell, he went down from his place of
              worship, to visit the prisoners, orphans, widowers, those in trouble,
              and the sojourners, as his strength allowed him, to help them from the
              price of the works of his hands. St. Palamon was fervent in his
              asceticism and worship. He persevered, all the days of his life, in the
              daily and nightly prayers, and watching all night in ascetic worships.
              St. Pachomius17, the father of the monastic cenobite, was the disciple
              of this saint. When St. Pachomius18 rejected paganism and adopted
              Christianity, he wished to live a life of asceticism and worship, so the
              priest of his hometown directed him to go to the great hermit Anba
              Palamon. Pachomius handed the care for the poor and the needy in his
              town to another elder monk, and went to Anba Palamon. When he arrived,
              he knocked the door of his cell. The old man looked from an aperture and
              asked him, "Who are you O brother? and what do you want?" Pachomius
              answered hastily, "I, O blessed father, looking for the Christ the God
              Whom you do worship, and I beg your fatherhood to accept me and to make
              me a monk." Abba Palamon told him, "O my son, monasticism is not an
              unrestricted labor, and the man does not come into it as he pleases, for
              many had adopted it not knowing its hardships, and when they adopted it
              they could not endure it, and you have heard about it without knowing
              its contention." Pachomius replied, "Do not turn my request, and my
              desire, and do not put off the flame of my zeal. Accept me, be patient
              with me, and examine me, and afterward do whatever you see fit with
              me." The old man told him, "Go, O my son test your self alone for a
              period of time, then come back to me for I am willing to labor with you
              as much as my weakness allows so you might know your own self. The
              monastic piety needs toughness and asceticism, and I will teach you
              first its extent. Then you go and examine your self if you could endure
              the matter or not. My intent in that, God knows, is for the sake of your
              teaching and discipline and not for any other reason. When we, O my
              beloved son, knew the vanity and trickery of this world, we came to this
              distant place, and carried on our shoulders the cross of our Christ, not
              the wooden rod, but the overcoming of the flesh, subduing its lusts, and
              wasting its power. We spent the night praying and glorifying God. Often
              we vigil from sun set till the morning praying and working much with our
              hands, making either ropes, braid palm fibers, weave palm leaves or hair
              to resist sleep and to have what our bodies need and to feed the poor as
              the apostle said, ''remember the needy.'' We entirely do not know the
              eating of oil, cooked food or drinking liquors. We fast till the evening
              of the summer days, and two days at a time during the winter then we
              break the fast by eating only bread and salt. We keep away the boredom
              by remembering death, and how close it is. We refute every pride and
              exaltation and guard ourselves from evil thoughts by humility and piety.
              By this ascetic strive that is accomplished by the grace of God, we
              offer our souls a living sacrifice, acceptable to God, not only once but
              many times. For according to the strive and how much we exert ourselves
              in it, we realize spiritual gifts, remembering the saying of the Lord,
              "Those overcame themselves, seize the Kingdom of Heaven." When
              Pachomius heard from Abba Palamon these sayings that he never heard
              before, he was more assured by the spirit, and was encouraged on facing
              the hardships and endure the pains. He replied saying, "I am confident
              in the Lord Christ first, and by the support of your prayers second, I
              would be able to fulfill all the precepts, and persevere with you till
              death." Pachomius then kneeled before him and kissed his hand. The old
              man preached him and instructed him about the importance of mortifying
              the flesh, the humility and contrition of the heart. He told him, "If
              you kept what I told you, did not go back, or vacillate between two
              opinions, we will rejoice with you." Then he told him, "Do you think
              my son that by all what I mentioned to you from asceticism, praying,
              watching and fasting we ask for the glory of men, no my son, it is not
              like that. We lead you to the works of salvation so we would be
              blameless, for it is written every apparent thing is light, and we must
              through many tribulations enter the kingdom of heaven. Now go back to
              your abode so you might examine your self and test her for few days for
              what you are asking is not an easy task." Pachomius answered him
              saying, "I have examined myself in every thing, and I hope with the
              Grace of God and your holy prayers, that your heart would be pleased
              toward me." The old man answered, "Well." Anba Palamon accepted him
              with joy, then left him for ten days testing him in prayer, watching and
              fasting. Three month later and after he tested his patience, endurance,
              strife and will, he prayed over him, clipped off his hair, and put on
              him the garb of the monks (El-Eskeem) in year 34 A.D. They persevered
              together on asceticism and prayer as they worked in their spare times in
              weaving hair and knitting clothes to gain their bare necessities, and
              what they spared they gave to the needy. Whenever they were vigilance
              and the sleep overcame them, they went out their cells and moved sand
              from one place to another to exhaust their bodies and remove the sleep
              away from them. The old man went on preaching the young man and
              encouraging him saying, "Be courageous O Pachomius, let your devotion
              to God always be flamed with the fire of love, and be before Him, in
              fear, humility, and persevering in praying and kneeling without boredom.
              Be watchful lest the tempter examine you and grief you." It came in the
              biography of St. Pachomius in a manuscript in the monastery of
              El-Baramous the following: One day someone knocked on the door of Sts.
              Palamon and Pachomius to visit them, and he spent the night with them.
              The pride and self-reliance had overcome that person. While they were
              talking about the words of God and before them was fire, for it was
              winter, the guest told them, "Whoever of you has strong faith in God,
              let him rise up, stand on this blazing embers, and recite the prayer
              which the Lord had taught to His disciples." When the old man St.
              Palamon heard that, he admonished him saying, "Cursed is the defiled
              devil who planted this thought in your heart. so stop talking." The
              guest did not head to the words of the old man and said, "I, I would."
              He rose up and stood on the blazing coal while saying the Lord''s prayer
              slowly. Then he stepped out the fire which did not touch his body with
              any harm, and went to his abode with arrogance. Pachomius told Anba
              Palamon, "God knows that I marveled about this brother who stood on the
              amber and his feet did not burn." The old man replied saying, "Do not
              be amazed for there is no doubt that this from the work of the Devil.
              The Lord had allowed his feet not to be burned as it is written to the
              crooked, God sends crooked ways. Believe me O my son, if you know the
              torment that is prepared for him, you will be weeping for his
              wretchedness." The Devil came to this man in the form of a woman and
              enticed him to allow her to enter his cell. Because of the pride and the
              blindness of his perception, he did not realize the danger that
              surrounded him. The lust filled his heart toward her, and immediately
              the devil struck and threw him on the ground and he remained as a dead
              man for a day. When he regained his conscious and his faculties, he went
              to Abba Palamon weeping and remorseful for what he had done. He asked
              for their help and prayers for the devil had captivated him by his own
              free will. While he was talking to them, the old man and his disciple
              were weeping, the evil spirit suddenly came over him. He went to the
              mountain, and he lost his mind. He was astray for a period of time, then
              he threw himself in a fire which burned him. When the old man knew that,
              he was grieved. His disciple asked him, "How God allowed this to happen
              to him after he confessed and asked for repentance with tears and
              remorse." The Abba answered, "God with His foreknowledge knew that the
              repentance of this brother was not sincere, so He allowed him to reap
              what he did." While St. Pachomius was still staying with his teacher
              Anba Palamon, one day he was wondering in the wilderness, and he came to
              the village of Tabanseen. When he was praying, the angel of the Lord
              appeared and told him, "O Pachomius, with the order of the Lord, build
              a monastery in the spot that your are standing on, hence many will come
              to you seeking monasticism." He returned to the old man Anba Palamon
              and told him what the angel had told him, and his intention of
              fulfilling the Will of God. Anba Palamon was sad for the departure of
              his disciple and said, "How could you leave me after seven years you
              spent with me in obedience and submission and I am an old man. I see
              that it is easier on me to accompany you than you leaving me." They
              moved south until they came to Tabanseen, and started to build a
              monastery. That was in the year 311 A.D., and Pachomius was thirty years
              old. When they finished building the monastery, Anba Palamon told his
              disciple Pachomius, "My beloved son I long to return to my cell and the
              place of my solitude. I had known that God had appointed you to
              establish this monastery, which will grow and be filled with God
              pleasing monks. You shall receive power and long suffering to manage
              them. As of my self, I have became old, weak, and the time of my
              departure had drew near. So I see that my solitary life is best for me.
              Nevertheless, I ask from your kindness that you do not deprive me from
              seeing you from now and then. I shall come to visit you as the few days
              left for me allow." They were separated after they prayed with each
              other, and they visited each other. In one of the visits of Anba
              Palamon, he became ill and departed to the Lord that he served and loved
              since his young age. Anba Pachomius took the blessings of his teacher,
              shrouded and buried him. Many wonders and miracles have been attributed
              to this saint. An ancient church in his name is located in the town of
              El-Kasre and El-Sayad in a monastery named after him which had other
              churches in the name of the Virgin St. Mary, the archangel Michael, St.
              Mercurius Abu-Saifain, and St. Demianah. A great festival celebration is
              celebrated annually in his feast day. May his prayers be with us and
              Glory be to God forever. Amen. _________________________________________
              17 The biography of St. Pachomius is under the fourteenth day of Bashans
              (Vol. III, P. 430). 18 When Constantine the Great was victorious,
              Pachomius'' military detachment returned to its post in Upper Egypt, and
              the soldiers were released to return to their hometown. St. Pachomius
              arrived to his town Chinu, and met its priest and asked him to join him
              to the congregation of his church. Since Pachomius was pagan as his
              parents, the priest wrote his name among the catechumens, but God
              inspired the priest to accept him among the believers. He baptized him
              in Maundy thursday, year 31 A.D., and he was twenty years old. He grew
              in virtues, ministering to the believers, and loving the people, until
              his merits became well known. Many people gathered around him. When an
              epidemic spread in this village, he served them, and brought them wood
              from far distances. The Lord had mercy on him and saved him from the
              epidemic, and remained three years visiting the orphans, and the widows,
              ministering to their needs, keeping himself from the defilement of the
              world.'

          arabic: 4. استشهاد القديسة ليارية
      text:
          english: 'This day also marks, the martyrdom of Sts. Thecla and Mouji (Mugi).
              They were born in the city of Kerakus, and they were brought up by a
              God-fearing woman, who was a teacher. Once when they were crossing the
              river they saw the governor torturing the Christians. They were amazed
              from his hard-heartedness. The angel of the Lord appeared to them, and
              showed them the glory of the saints. They went to Alexandria, where they
              confessed the Lord Christ before the governor, who tortured them
              severely. Then, he cut off the head of St. Mouji. As off St. Thecla, he
              sent her to the city of Demtaw, where she was martyred, after much
              torture. Thus they received the crown of martyrdom. May there prayers be
              with us. Amen. 5. The Martyrdom of St. Antonius (Anthony) of Beba. 5.
              Today also, St. Antonius (Andona), was martyred. He was born in the city
              of Beba, to pious and merciful parents. When he heard about the torture
              of the martyrs, he went to Ansena, and confessed the Lord Christ before
              the governor. The governor ordered him shut to death with arrows. When
              no harm came upon him, he sent him bound with St. Abimachus and two
              other martyrs to Alexandria. The Governor shut up the three in prison
              and crucified St. Antonius head downwards but he was not harmed. When
              the governor became weary of torturing him, he sent him to the governor
              of Farma. There he found St. Mina in prison, and they rejoiced for their
              meeting. The governor of Farma tortured Antonius, at times by combing
              his body with iron combs, and at other times by casting him in a
              cauldron filled with boiling oil, but the Lord strengthened and healed
              him. Afterwards, they cut off his head and thus he received the crown of
              martyrdom. May his prayers be with us. Amen. 6. The Martyrdom of St.
              Abakragoun. On this day also, St. Abakragoun, who was from El-Batanoon,
              was martyred. He was formerly a thief. Two young men plotted with him to
              steal. They went to the cell of a monk, and they found him keeping a
              vigil, praying. They waited until he had finished his prayer and had
              lain down. Nevertheless, he remained standing praying until they became
              weary and troubled. At dawn, the old monk went out to the thieves, and
              when they saw him they bowed down before him, and cast down their
              swords. He preached to them, taught them, and they became monks under
              his direction. St. Abakragoun fought a very great fight, and devoted
              himself to the ascetic life. The old monk prophesied to him that he
              would receive the crown of martyrdom for the Name of Christ, and his
              saying was fulfilled later on. Six years latter the devil incited
              persecution against the church, St. Abakragoun bid his spiritual father
              farewell and took his blessings. He went to Nakios, and confessed the
              Name of the Lord Christ before the governor, who was appointed by
              Maximianus Caesar. The governor tortured him much and then took him to
              Alexandria. Then he was tortured by hanging him on the mast of the ship
              five times, and each time the ropes broke. Then they placed him in a
              sack made of hide, and threw him into the sea. The angel of the Lord
              brought him out of the water, and commanded him to go to Samanoud. On
              his way he passed by the city of El-Benwan, and its people recognized
              him. They brought to him everyone who had an infirmity and they were
              healed by his prayers. When he arrived at Samanoud, God wrought on his
              hands many signs. He raised, by his prayers, the daughter of Justus the
              Vizier from the dead. Justus, his wife, and all his soldiers, believed,
              and they all received the crown of martyrdom, and they were numbered,
              nine hundred thirty-five men. As for St. Abakragoun, they sent him back
              to Alexandria. After they tortured him with different kinds of tortures,
              they cut off his head, and he received the crown of martyrdom. The angel
              of the Lord appeared to a priest from the city of Menuf, told him about
              the place of the body of the saint, and the priest went and took it.
              After the end of the time of persecution, they built a church in his
              name in the city of El-Batanoon, and placed his body in it. May his
              prayers be with us. Amen. 7. The Martyrdom of St. Domadius El-Souriani
              (The Syrian). This day also, marks the martyrdom of St. Domadius
              El-Souriani (The Syrian). He was brought up in Persia, and learned
              Astrology, and wished to become Christian. One day he found a Persian
              monk in the market, whose name was Aughalis, who taught him the way of
              God and he rejoiced exceedingly. He began to preach to the people of his
              house, and to teach them what might facilitate them to the path of
              Faith. Then he was baptized, and became a monk. He performed many great
              deeds that the brethren were jealous of him. When he felt that, he left
              them and went to the monastery of St. Sergius. There he lived with a
              hermit for ten years during which he did not eat any cooked food. Then
              they ordained him a deacon. While he was ministering with the hermit
              priest in the sanctuary, he saw a white dove of most beautiful
              appearance, which came down and descended upon the altar. Domadius
              thought that it was a real dove, so he made a motion with his hand to
              drive the dove off, for he was worried about the content of the chalice.
              After the service was ended, the priest asked him, "What did disturb
              you during the liturgy?" Domadius told him what he had seen. The priest
              told him, "If you see the dove again tell me." In the next day, the
              priest went up to the altar to celebrate the liturgy as usual, and when
              Domadius saw the dove, he told the priest, "My father the dove has
              come." The priest looked around but he could not see anything. He bowed
              his head before God with weeping and prayer by day and night for a
              period of time, until he was worthy to see this dove. He realized that
              this was the sign of the Holy Spirit. He did not say anything to St.
              Domadius lest pride fill his heart, but he told the bishop who had
              ordained him a priest. When the news of his holiness reached the
              patriarch of this area, he wished to visit him. When St. Domadius knew
              of this, he fled from there and came to the church of St. Cosmas, where
              he lived for a while nearby, feeding on the vegetation of the earth. God
              wrought on his hand many signs and miracles. When Emperor Julian went
              out to fight against the Persians, he passed by the cave of this saint.
              They told him about the saint, so he ordered him stoned. The soldiers
              stoned him and his disciple, until a great heap of stones stood over the
              cave. Many years later, God revealed his body, a church was built for
              him and God manifested many wonders in it. May his prayers be with us.
              Amen. 8. The Consecration of the Church of St. Mercurius. Today also the
              church celebrates the commemoration of the consecration of the church of
              the great St. Mercurius Abu-Saifain. The biography of his life is
              written under the twenty- fifth day of the month of Hatour. May his
              blessing be with us. Amen. 9. The Departure of St. Palamon, the Father
              of the Monks. On this day also, of the year 316 A.M., the saint Anba
              Palamon the anchorite, departed. He was an anchorite in the Eastern
              Mount in a town called El-Kasre and El-Sayad, district of Nagaa-Hammady,
              governorate of Quena. The Devil was weary of tempting this father, and
              failed to overcome him. The Devil took every chance to direct his snares
              against him. One day, the man of God Anba Palamon rose up, took the work
              of his hand, and walked toward the countryside of Egypt. While he was
              walking in his way, he was weeping for his sins. The enemy of the good
              led him astray in the mountain, for seven days, until he was close to
              death from hunger and thirst, for it was summer. Finally, he collapsed,
              fell on the ground, wishing to die. God, the lover of mankind, wished
              not to leave His servant Anba Palamon fall prey to the devil, so He
              ordered the devil to leave him. When the old man realized that, he cried
              saying, "O Lord Jesus Christ help me." Instantly he heard a voice
              saying to him, "Do not be afraid, for the enemy can not overcome you.
              Rise and walk a short distance to the south. You shall find a righteous
              old monk whose name is Talasoun. Tell him about all that the devil has
              brought on you, and the grievous sin that he tempted you with in your
              young age. He will pray on your behalf so that your sins will be
              forgiven." The blessed Anba Palamon rose up, carried the works of his
              hands, and walked in the mount reciting Psalm fifty four, "Save me, O
              God, by Your name, And vindicate me by Your strength. Hear my prayer, O
              God; Give ear to the words of my mouth. For strangers have risen up
              against me, And oppressors have sought after my life; They have not set
              God before them. Behold, God is my helper; The Lord is with those who
              uphold my life. He will repay my enemies for their evil. Cut them off in
              Your truth. I will freely sacrifice to You; I will praise Your name, O
              LORD, for it is good. For He has delivered me out of all trouble; And my
              eye has seen its desire upon my enemies." He also recited Psalms 68,
              "Let God arise, Let His enemies be scattered; Let those also who hate
              Him flee before Him. As smoke is driven away, So drive them away; As wax
              melts before the fire, So let the wicked perish at the presence of God.
              But let the righteous be glad; Let them rejoice before God; Yes, let
              them rejoice exceedingly." He did not cease praying until God guided
              him to the place of Anba Talasoun. When Anba Talasoun saw him, he
              rejoiced exceedingly, greeted him, held his hand and pulled him up the
              rock where he lived. They prayed, then sat down talking about the
              greatness of God. Anba Talasoun asked Anba Palamon about how he found
              his way to come to visit him in this wilderness. Then Anba Palamon
              started crying and kneeled, saying, "Please forgive me O my beloved
              holy father." Anba Talasoun said, "The Lord Jesus Christ forgives to
              all of us all our transgressions." Anba Palamon replied saying, "I am
              ashamed to tell you, O my holy father, about the enormous sin that
              befell me by the Devil without knowing." Anba Talasoun told him, "It
              is written ''Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for
              another, that you may be healed.''" When Anba Palamon saw that the
              blessed Anba Talasoun was comforting and encouraging him, he started to
              tell him, "While I was living in the monastery, I asked God to forgive
              me my sins. I also read in the holy books of the fathers which are
              inspired by the Spirit of God, that solitary life brings forth the fear
              of God, and God despises mockery and laughing for no reason. So I
              decided to live a solitary life in my small home, to not talk to anyone,
              and never to laugh, but to cry on my sins by day and night. The Devil
              often fought against me. He tried to please my heart with laughter but I
              did not heed him, and I never cursed. I fought for a long time through
              these tribulations, steadfast in the salvation of our Lord Christ until
              the enemy was wrath with me. One day I took the work of my hands, walked
              in the mount to go to sell it and buy a little of bread. After I was at
              a considerable distance from my abode, the Devil captivated me, and
              right away I lost my mind. He removed the Name of God from my mouth and
              I was no longer reciting the Divine sayings. The mount changed entirely
              before me, the sandy earth became black. When I looked before me I saw a
              new city, had splendid buildings, magnificent houses, rich palaces, and
              the city had shining armored gat which was fortified as a city of a
              king, surrounded by trees and gardens. When I saw it, I wondered about
              this city and its great distinction."When I inclined to enter the city
              thinking that its people might buy from me the work of my hands. As I
              came close to the walls of the city, I found a turning water wheel
              (sakieh), and I saw a sorrowful woman. Her face was very gloomy. Her
              clothes were torn and her veil covered her eyes for the sake of decency.
              She was standing beside the well, running the water wheel and watering
              the vines. When she saw me, she sat down, covered her head and said,
              ''Bless me O my holy father.'' In hast she put down the baskets before me
              then said, ''Sit down and rest O my beloved father for you had become
              tired from what you have carried.'' She sat me down beside running water,
              she took water in her hands, poured it on my feet, and washed them as
              someone taking blessings. She acted as a woman of a rich man. I asked
              her, ''O faithful woman, tell me, if I enter this city with the work of
              my hands would I find one who would buy it from me?'' She said, ''Yes,
              they would buy it from you. Nevertheless, leave it and I will buy it
              from you, and I will give you all that you need. For I was married to a
              rich man who died recently and left me much money and herds of cattle. I
              pick the fruits of these enormous vines, and I do not have anyone to
              oversee it. I wish to have a man like you, to whom I can hand all my
              possessions, to handle the way he sees fit. So if you accept, O my holy
              father, to come and oversee my house and to take charge of all my
              possessions, I will take you as a husband.'' I replied, ''If the monk gets
              married, shame and disgrace follow him.'' Then the woman told me, ''If you
              do not take me as a wife, be an overseer for my possessions. You
              supervise it during the day, for I own fields, cattle, barns, vineyards,
              slaves and maiden servants, and when the night falls you shall fulfill
              your prayers.'' Then she rose up, and took me to her house. She prepared
              a table of different kinds of foods and placed it before me. Afterwards,
              she went to her room, and put on expensive and extravagant clothes, then
              came and embraced me. I was surprised and I held fast to the power of
              God almighty, and crossed myself with the sign of the cross. All that I
              saw immediately vanished as the smoke before the winds, and nothing of
              what this woman did remained. "Instantly, I realized that all of this
              was the doing of the Devil who wished to make me fall in sin. I cried
              bitterly, and regretted much what I had done. The Lord had compassion on
              me with His tender mercy, and sent me His angel who comforted me, and
              promised the forgiveness of my sins and told me, ''Go to the saint Anba
              Talasoun who is nearby you, and confess to him your sins. Tell him that
              you have come to him so that the Lord may forgive your sins through his
              prayers.''" The saint Anba Talasoun prayed saying, "O my son may the
              Lord forgive you and myself." Subsequently, a table came down from
              heaven, they ate, then Anba Palamon returned to his place of worship in
              peace. This Saint received the gift of healing from God. The beasts were
              friendly to him, he fed them by his hands, and they licked his feet. He
              lived naked, so God lengthened his hair until it covered his whole body.
              He fasted the whole week, only ate on Saturday and Sunday. He ate a half
              loaf of bread that God sent him with the raven. Often he ate from the
              vegetation of the mount. He was merciful, compassionate, and tender like
              His creator. When the night fell, he went down from his place of
              worship, to visit the prisoners, orphans, widowers, those in trouble,
              and the sojourners, as his strength allowed him, to help them from the
              price of the works of his hands. St. Palamon was fervent in his
              asceticism and worship. He persevered, all the days of his life, in the
              daily and nightly prayers, and watching all night in ascetic worships.
              St. Pachomius17, the father of the monastic cenobite, was the disciple
              of this saint. When St. Pachomius18 rejected paganism and adopted
              Christianity, he wished to live a life of asceticism and worship, so the
              priest of his hometown directed him to go to the great hermit Anba
              Palamon. Pachomius handed the care for the poor and the needy in his
              town to another elder monk, and went to Anba Palamon. When he arrived,
              he knocked the door of his cell. The old man looked from an aperture and
              asked him, "Who are you O brother? and what do you want?" Pachomius
              answered hastily, "I, O blessed father, looking for the Christ the God
              Whom you do worship, and I beg your fatherhood to accept me and to make
              me a monk." Abba Palamon told him, "O my son, monasticism is not an
              unrestricted labor, and the man does not come into it as he pleases, for
              many had adopted it not knowing its hardships, and when they adopted it
              they could not endure it, and you have heard about it without knowing
              its contention." Pachomius replied, "Do not turn my request, and my
              desire, and do not put off the flame of my zeal. Accept me, be patient
              with me, and examine me, and afterward do whatever you see fit with
              me." The old man told him, "Go, O my son test your self alone for a
              period of time, then come back to me for I am willing to labor with you
              as much as my weakness allows so you might know your own self. The
              monastic piety needs toughness and asceticism, and I will teach you
              first its extent. Then you go and examine your self if you could endure
              the matter or not. My intent in that, God knows, is for the sake of your
              teaching and discipline and not for any other reason. When we, O my
              beloved son, knew the vanity and trickery of this world, we came to this
              distant place, and carried on our shoulders the cross of our Christ, not
              the wooden rod, but the overcoming of the flesh, subduing its lusts, and
              wasting its power. We spent the night praying and glorifying God. Often
              we vigil from sun set till the morning praying and working much with our
              hands, making either ropes, braid palm fibers, weave palm leaves or hair
              to resist sleep and to have what our bodies need and to feed the poor as
              the apostle said, ''remember the needy.'' We entirely do not know the
              eating of oil, cooked food or drinking liquors. We fast till the evening
              of the summer days, and two days at a time during the winter then we
              break the fast by eating only bread and salt. We keep away the boredom
              by remembering death, and how close it is. We refute every pride and
              exaltation and guard ourselves from evil thoughts by humility and piety.
              By this ascetic strive that is accomplished by the grace of God, we
              offer our souls a living sacrifice, acceptable to God, not only once but
              many times. For according to the strive and how much we exert ourselves
              in it, we realize spiritual gifts, remembering the saying of the Lord,
              "Those overcame themselves, seize the Kingdom of Heaven." When
              Pachomius heard from Abba Palamon these sayings that he never heard
              before, he was more assured by the spirit, and was encouraged on facing
              the hardships and endure the pains. He replied saying, "I am confident
              in the Lord Christ first, and by the support of your prayers second, I
              would be able to fulfill all the precepts, and persevere with you till
              death." Pachomius then kneeled before him and kissed his hand. The old
              man preached him and instructed him about the importance of mortifying
              the flesh, the humility and contrition of the heart. He told him, "If
              you kept what I told you, did not go back, or vacillate between two
              opinions, we will rejoice with you." Then he told him, "Do you think
              my son that by all what I mentioned to you from asceticism, praying,
              watching and fasting we ask for the glory of men, no my son, it is not
              like that. We lead you to the works of salvation so we would be
              blameless, for it is written every apparent thing is light, and we must
              through many tribulations enter the kingdom of heaven. Now go back to
              your abode so you might examine your self and test her for few days for
              what you are asking is not an easy task." Pachomius answered him
              saying, "I have examined myself in every thing, and I hope with the
              Grace of God and your holy prayers, that your heart would be pleased
              toward me." The old man answered, "Well." Anba Palamon accepted him
              with joy, then left him for ten days testing him in prayer, watching and
              fasting. Three month later and after he tested his patience, endurance,
              strife and will, he prayed over him, clipped off his hair, and put on
              him the garb of the monks (El-Eskeem) in year 34 A.D. They persevered
              together on asceticism and prayer as they worked in their spare times in
              weaving hair and knitting clothes to gain their bare necessities, and
              what they spared they gave to the needy. Whenever they were vigilance
              and the sleep overcame them, they went out their cells and moved sand
              from one place to another to exhaust their bodies and remove the sleep
              away from them. The old man went on preaching the young man and
              encouraging him saying, "Be courageous O Pachomius, let your devotion
              to God always be flamed with the fire of love, and be before Him, in
              fear, humility, and persevering in praying and kneeling without boredom.
              Be watchful lest the tempter examine you and grief you." It came in the
              biography of St. Pachomius in a manuscript in the monastery of
              El-Baramous the following: One day someone knocked on the door of Sts.
              Palamon and Pachomius to visit them, and he spent the night with them.
              The pride and self-reliance had overcome that person. While they were
              talking about the words of God and before them was fire, for it was
              winter, the guest told them, "Whoever of you has strong faith in God,
              let him rise up, stand on this blazing embers, and recite the prayer
              which the Lord had taught to His disciples." When the old man St.
              Palamon heard that, he admonished him saying, "Cursed is the defiled
              devil who planted this thought in your heart. so stop talking." The
              guest did not head to the words of the old man and said, "I, I would."
              He rose up and stood on the blazing coal while saying the Lord''s prayer
              slowly. Then he stepped out the fire which did not touch his body with
              any harm, and went to his abode with arrogance. Pachomius told Anba
              Palamon, "God knows that I marveled about this brother who stood on the
              amber and his feet did not burn." The old man replied saying, "Do not
              be amazed for there is no doubt that this from the work of the Devil.
              The Lord had allowed his feet not to be burned as it is written to the
              crooked, God sends crooked ways. Believe me O my son, if you know the
              torment that is prepared for him, you will be weeping for his
              wretchedness." The Devil came to this man in the form of a woman and
              enticed him to allow her to enter his cell. Because of the pride and the
              blindness of his perception, he did not realize the danger that
              surrounded him. The lust filled his heart toward her, and immediately
              the devil struck and threw him on the ground and he remained as a dead
              man for a day. When he regained his conscious and his faculties, he went
              to Abba Palamon weeping and remorseful for what he had done. He asked
              for their help and prayers for the devil had captivated him by his own
              free will. While he was talking to them, the old man and his disciple
              were weeping, the evil spirit suddenly came over him. He went to the
              mountain, and he lost his mind. He was astray for a period of time, then
              he threw himself in a fire which burned him. When the old man knew that,
              he was grieved. His disciple asked him, "How God allowed this to happen
              to him after he confessed and asked for repentance with tears and
              remorse." The Abba answered, "God with His foreknowledge knew that the
              repentance of this brother was not sincere, so He allowed him to reap
              what he did." While St. Pachomius was still staying with his teacher
              Anba Palamon, one day he was wondering in the wilderness, and he came to
              the village of Tabanseen. When he was praying, the angel of the Lord
              appeared and told him, "O Pachomius, with the order of the Lord, build
              a monastery in the spot that your are standing on, hence many will come
              to you seeking monasticism." He returned to the old man Anba Palamon
              and told him what the angel had told him, and his intention of
              fulfilling the Will of God. Anba Palamon was sad for the departure of
              his disciple and said, "How could you leave me after seven years you
              spent with me in obedience and submission and I am an old man. I see
              that it is easier on me to accompany you than you leaving me." They
              moved south until they came to Tabanseen, and started to build a
              monastery. That was in the year 311 A.D., and Pachomius was thirty years
              old. When they finished building the monastery, Anba Palamon told his
              disciple Pachomius, "My beloved son I long to return to my cell and the
              place of my solitude. I had known that God had appointed you to
              establish this monastery, which will grow and be filled with God
              pleasing monks. You shall receive power and long suffering to manage
              them. As of my self, I have became old, weak, and the time of my
              departure had drew near. So I see that my solitary life is best for me.
              Nevertheless, I ask from your kindness that you do not deprive me from
              seeing you from now and then. I shall come to visit you as the few days
              left for me allow." They were separated after they prayed with each
              other, and they visited each other. In one of the visits of Anba
              Palamon, he became ill and departed to the Lord that he served and loved
              since his young age. Anba Pachomius took the blessings of his teacher,
              shrouded and buried him. Many wonders and miracles have been attributed
              to this saint. An ancient church in his name is located in the town of
              El-Kasre and El-Sayad in a monastery named after him which had other
              churches in the name of the Virgin St. Mary, the archangel Michael, St.
              Mercurius Abu-Saifain, and St. Demianah. A great festival celebration is
              celebrated annually in his feast day. May his prayers be with us and
              Glory be to God forever. Amen. _________________________________________
              17 The biography of St. Pachomius is under the fourteenth day of Bashans
              (Vol. III, P. 430). 18 When Constantine the Great was victorious,
              Pachomius'' military detachment returned to its post in Upper Egypt, and
              the soldiers were released to return to their hometown. St. Pachomius
              arrived to his town Chinu, and met its priest and asked him to join him
              to the congregation of his church. Since Pachomius was pagan as his
              parents, the priest wrote his name among the catechumens, but God
              inspired the priest to accept him among the believers. He baptized him
              in Maundy thursday, year 31 A.D., and he was twenty years old. He grew
              in virtues, ministering to the believers, and loving the people, until
              his merits became well known. Many people gathered around him. When an
              epidemic spread in this village, he served them, and brought them wood
              from far distances. The Lord had mercy on him and saved him from the
              epidemic, and remained three years visiting the orphans, and the widows,
              ministering to their needs, keeping himself from the defilement of the
              world.'

              ، من أبوين مسيحيين تقيين فنشأت علي الطهارة وكانت مداوية علي الصوم
              والصلاة ولما بلغت من العمر اثنتي عشر سنة ظهر لها ملاك الرب وهي تعمل وقال
              لها:لماذا أنت جالسة هنا والجهاد قائم والإكليل معد فوزعت كل مالها وأتت
              إلى طوه ومنها إلى سرسنا (مركز الشهداء منوفية ) فوجدت الوالي واعترفت
              أمامه بالسيد المسيح فعذبها كثيرا وكان هناك القديس شنوسي الذي كان يعزيها
              ويشجعها . أما الوالي فقد شدد عليها العذاب حيث مشط لحمها ووضع في أذنيها
              مسامير ساخنة ثم ربطها مع سبعة آلاف وستمائة شهيد وأخذهم معه وسافر وفيما
              هم في المركب قفز تمساح من البحر وخطف طفلا وحيدا لامه فبكت وولولت عليه
              فتحننت عليها هذه القديسة وصلت إلى السيد المسيح . فأعاد التمساح الطفل حيا

          english: 5. The Martyrdom of St. Antonius (Anthony) of Beba.
          arabic: 5. استشهاد القديس أبا اسحق
      text:
          english: '5. Today also, St. Antonius (Andona), was martyred. He was born in the
              city of Beba, to pious and merciful parents. When he heard about the
              torture of the martyrs, he went to Ansena, and confessed the Lord Christ
              before the governor. The governor ordered him shut to death with arrows.
              When no harm came upon him, he sent him bound with St. Abimachus and two
              other martyrs to Alexandria. The Governor shut up the three in prison
              and crucified St. Antonius head downwards but he was not harmed. When
              the governor became weary of torturing him, he sent him to the governor
              of Farma. There he found St. Mina in prison, and they rejoiced for their
              meeting. The governor of Farma tortured Antonius, at times by combing
              his body with iron combs, and at other times by casting him in a
              cauldron filled with boiling oil, but the Lord strengthened and healed
              him. Afterwards, they cut off his head and thus he received the crown of
              martyrdom. May his prayers be with us. Amen. 6. The Martyrdom of St.
              Abakragoun. On this day also, St. Abakragoun, who was from El-Batanoon,
              was martyred. He was formerly a thief. Two young men plotted with him to
              steal. They went to the cell of a monk, and they found him keeping a
              vigil, praying. They waited until he had finished his prayer and had
              lain down. Nevertheless, he remained standing praying until they became
              weary and troubled. At dawn, the old monk went out to the thieves, and
              when they saw him they bowed down before him, and cast down their
              swords. He preached to them, taught them, and they became monks under
              his direction. St. Abakragoun fought a very great fight, and devoted
              himself to the ascetic life. The old monk prophesied to him that he
              would receive the crown of martyrdom for the Name of Christ, and his
              saying was fulfilled later on. Six years latter the devil incited
              persecution against the church, St. Abakragoun bid his spiritual father
              farewell and took his blessings. He went to Nakios, and confessed the
              Name of the Lord Christ before the governor, who was appointed by
              Maximianus Caesar. The governor tortured him much and then took him to
              Alexandria. Then he was tortured by hanging him on the mast of the ship
              five times, and each time the ropes broke. Then they placed him in a
              sack made of hide, and threw him into the sea. The angel of the Lord
              brought him out of the water, and commanded him to go to Samanoud. On
              his way he passed by the city of El-Benwan, and its people recognized
              him. They brought to him everyone who had an infirmity and they were
              healed by his prayers. When he arrived at Samanoud, God wrought on his
              hands many signs. He raised, by his prayers, the daughter of Justus the
              Vizier from the dead. Justus, his wife, and all his soldiers, believed,
              and they all received the crown of martyrdom, and they were numbered,
              nine hundred thirty-five men. As for St. Abakragoun, they sent him back
              to Alexandria. After they tortured him with different kinds of tortures,
              they cut off his head, and he received the crown of martyrdom. The angel
              of the Lord appeared to a priest from the city of Menuf, told him about
              the place of the body of the saint, and the priest went and took it.
              After the end of the time of persecution, they built a church in his
              name in the city of El-Batanoon, and placed his body in it. May his
              prayers be with us. Amen. 7. The Martyrdom of St. Domadius El-Souriani
              (The Syrian). This day also, marks the martyrdom of St. Domadius
              El-Souriani (The Syrian). He was brought up in Persia, and learned
              Astrology, and wished to become Christian. One day he found a Persian
              monk in the market, whose name was Aughalis, who taught him the way of
              God and he rejoiced exceedingly. He began to preach to the people of his
              house, and to teach them what might facilitate them to the path of
              Faith. Then he was baptized, and became a monk. He performed many great
              deeds that the brethren were jealous of him. When he felt that, he left
              them and went to the monastery of St. Sergius. There he lived with a
              hermit for ten years during which he did not eat any cooked food. Then
              they ordained him a deacon. While he was ministering with the hermit
              priest in the sanctuary, he saw a white dove of most beautiful
              appearance, which came down and descended upon the altar. Domadius
              thought that it was a real dove, so he made a motion with his hand to
              drive the dove off, for he was worried about the content of the chalice.
              After the service was ended, the priest asked him, "What did disturb
              you during the liturgy?" Domadius told him what he had seen. The priest
              told him, "If you see the dove again tell me." In the next day, the
              priest went up to the altar to celebrate the liturgy as usual, and when
              Domadius saw the dove, he told the priest, "My father the dove has
              come." The priest looked around but he could not see anything. He bowed
              his head before God with weeping and prayer by day and night for a
              period of time, until he was worthy to see this dove. He realized that
              this was the sign of the Holy Spirit. He did not say anything to St.
              Domadius lest pride fill his heart, but he told the bishop who had
              ordained him a priest. When the news of his holiness reached the
              patriarch of this area, he wished to visit him. When St. Domadius knew
              of this, he fled from there and came to the church of St. Cosmas, where
              he lived for a while nearby, feeding on the vegetation of the earth. God
              wrought on his hand many signs and miracles. When Emperor Julian went
              out to fight against the Persians, he passed by the cave of this saint.
              They told him about the saint, so he ordered him stoned. The soldiers
              stoned him and his disciple, until a great heap of stones stood over the
              cave. Many years later, God revealed his body, a church was built for
              him and God manifested many wonders in it. May his prayers be with us.
              Amen. 8. The Consecration of the Church of St. Mercurius. Today also the
              church celebrates the commemoration of the consecration of the church of
              the great St. Mercurius Abu-Saifain. The biography of his life is
              written under the twenty- fifth day of the month of Hatour. May his
              blessing be with us. Amen. 9. The Departure of St. Palamon, the Father
              of the Monks. On this day also, of the year 316 A.M., the saint Anba
              Palamon the anchorite, departed. He was an anchorite in the Eastern
              Mount in a town called El-Kasre and El-Sayad, district of Nagaa-Hammady,
              governorate of Quena. The Devil was weary of tempting this father, and
              failed to overcome him. The Devil took every chance to direct his snares
              against him. One day, the man of God Anba Palamon rose up, took the work
              of his hand, and walked toward the countryside of Egypt. While he was
              walking in his way, he was weeping for his sins. The enemy of the good
              led him astray in the mountain, for seven days, until he was close to
              death from hunger and thirst, for it was summer. Finally, he collapsed,
              fell on the ground, wishing to die. God, the lover of mankind, wished
              not to leave His servant Anba Palamon fall prey to the devil, so He
              ordered the devil to leave him. When the old man realized that, he cried
              saying, "O Lord Jesus Christ help me." Instantly he heard a voice
              saying to him, "Do not be afraid, for the enemy can not overcome you.
              Rise and walk a short distance to the south. You shall find a righteous
              old monk whose name is Talasoun. Tell him about all that the devil has
              brought on you, and the grievous sin that he tempted you with in your
              young age. He will pray on your behalf so that your sins will be
              forgiven." The blessed Anba Palamon rose up, carried the works of his
              hands, and walked in the mount reciting Psalm fifty four, "Save me, O
              God, by Your name, And vindicate me by Your strength. Hear my prayer, O
              God; Give ear to the words of my mouth. For strangers have risen up
              against me, And oppressors have sought after my life; They have not set
              God before them. Behold, God is my helper; The Lord is with those who
              uphold my life. He will repay my enemies for their evil. Cut them off in
              Your truth. I will freely sacrifice to You; I will praise Your name, O
              LORD, for it is good. For He has delivered me out of all trouble; And my
              eye has seen its desire upon my enemies." He also recited Psalms 68,
              "Let God arise, Let His enemies be scattered; Let those also who hate
              Him flee before Him. As smoke is driven away, So drive them away; As wax
              melts before the fire, So let the wicked perish at the presence of God.
              But let the righteous be glad; Let them rejoice before God; Yes, let
              them rejoice exceedingly." He did not cease praying until God guided
              him to the place of Anba Talasoun. When Anba Talasoun saw him, he
              rejoiced exceedingly, greeted him, held his hand and pulled him up the
              rock where he lived. They prayed, then sat down talking about the
              greatness of God. Anba Talasoun asked Anba Palamon about how he found
              his way to come to visit him in this wilderness. Then Anba Palamon
              started crying and kneeled, saying, "Please forgive me O my beloved
              holy father." Anba Talasoun said, "The Lord Jesus Christ forgives to
              all of us all our transgressions." Anba Palamon replied saying, "I am
              ashamed to tell you, O my holy father, about the enormous sin that
              befell me by the Devil without knowing." Anba Talasoun told him, "It
              is written ''Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for
              another, that you may be healed.''" When Anba Palamon saw that the
              blessed Anba Talasoun was comforting and encouraging him, he started to
              tell him, "While I was living in the monastery, I asked God to forgive
              me my sins. I also read in the holy books of the fathers which are
              inspired by the Spirit of God, that solitary life brings forth the fear
              of God, and God despises mockery and laughing for no reason. So I
              decided to live a solitary life in my small home, to not talk to anyone,
              and never to laugh, but to cry on my sins by day and night. The Devil
              often fought against me. He tried to please my heart with laughter but I
              did not heed him, and I never cursed. I fought for a long time through
              these tribulations, steadfast in the salvation of our Lord Christ until
              the enemy was wrath with me. One day I took the work of my hands, walked
              in the mount to go to sell it and buy a little of bread. After I was at
              a considerable distance from my abode, the Devil captivated me, and
              right away I lost my mind. He removed the Name of God from my mouth and
              I was no longer reciting the Divine sayings. The mount changed entirely
              before me, the sandy earth became black. When I looked before me I saw a
              new city, had splendid buildings, magnificent houses, rich palaces, and
              the city had shining armored gat which was fortified as a city of a
              king, surrounded by trees and gardens. When I saw it, I wondered about
              this city and its great distinction."When I inclined to enter the city
              thinking that its people might buy from me the work of my hands. As I
              came close to the walls of the city, I found a turning water wheel
              (sakieh), and I saw a sorrowful woman. Her face was very gloomy. Her
              clothes were torn and her veil covered her eyes for the sake of decency.
              She was standing beside the well, running the water wheel and watering
              the vines. When she saw me, she sat down, covered her head and said,
              ''Bless me O my holy father.'' In hast she put down the baskets before me
              then said, ''Sit down and rest O my beloved father for you had become
              tired from what you have carried.'' She sat me down beside running water,
              she took water in her hands, poured it on my feet, and washed them as
              someone taking blessings. She acted as a woman of a rich man. I asked
              her, ''O faithful woman, tell me, if I enter this city with the work of
              my hands would I find one who would buy it from me?'' She said, ''Yes,
              they would buy it from you. Nevertheless, leave it and I will buy it
              from you, and I will give you all that you need. For I was married to a
              rich man who died recently and left me much money and herds of cattle. I
              pick the fruits of these enormous vines, and I do not have anyone to
              oversee it. I wish to have a man like you, to whom I can hand all my
              possessions, to handle the way he sees fit. So if you accept, O my holy
              father, to come and oversee my house and to take charge of all my
              possessions, I will take you as a husband.'' I replied, ''If the monk gets
              married, shame and disgrace follow him.'' Then the woman told me, ''If you
              do not take me as a wife, be an overseer for my possessions. You
              supervise it during the day, for I own fields, cattle, barns, vineyards,
              slaves and maiden servants, and when the night falls you shall fulfill
              your prayers.'' Then she rose up, and took me to her house. She prepared
              a table of different kinds of foods and placed it before me. Afterwards,
              she went to her room, and put on expensive and extravagant clothes, then
              came and embraced me. I was surprised and I held fast to the power of
              God almighty, and crossed myself with the sign of the cross. All that I
              saw immediately vanished as the smoke before the winds, and nothing of
              what this woman did remained. "Instantly, I realized that all of this
              was the doing of the Devil who wished to make me fall in sin. I cried
              bitterly, and regretted much what I had done. The Lord had compassion on
              me with His tender mercy, and sent me His angel who comforted me, and
              promised the forgiveness of my sins and told me, ''Go to the saint Anba
              Talasoun who is nearby you, and confess to him your sins. Tell him that
              you have come to him so that the Lord may forgive your sins through his
              prayers.''" The saint Anba Talasoun prayed saying, "O my son may the
              Lord forgive you and myself." Subsequently, a table came down from
              heaven, they ate, then Anba Palamon returned to his place of worship in
              peace. This Saint received the gift of healing from God. The beasts were
              friendly to him, he fed them by his hands, and they licked his feet. He
              lived naked, so God lengthened his hair until it covered his whole body.
              He fasted the whole week, only ate on Saturday and Sunday. He ate a half
              loaf of bread that God sent him with the raven. Often he ate from the
              vegetation of the mount. He was merciful, compassionate, and tender like
              His creator. When the night fell, he went down from his place of
              worship, to visit the prisoners, orphans, widowers, those in trouble,
              and the sojourners, as his strength allowed him, to help them from the
              price of the works of his hands. St. Palamon was fervent in his
              asceticism and worship. He persevered, all the days of his life, in the
              daily and nightly prayers, and watching all night in ascetic worships.
              St. Pachomius17, the father of the monastic cenobite, was the disciple
              of this saint. When St. Pachomius18 rejected paganism and adopted
              Christianity, he wished to live a life of asceticism and worship, so the
              priest of his hometown directed him to go to the great hermit Anba
              Palamon. Pachomius handed the care for the poor and the needy in his
              town to another elder monk, and went to Anba Palamon. When he arrived,
              he knocked the door of his cell. The old man looked from an aperture and
              asked him, "Who are you O brother? and what do you want?" Pachomius
              answered hastily, "I, O blessed father, looking for the Christ the God
              Whom you do worship, and I beg your fatherhood to accept me and to make
              me a monk." Abba Palamon told him, "O my son, monasticism is not an
              unrestricted labor, and the man does not come into it as he pleases, for
              many had adopted it not knowing its hardships, and when they adopted it
              they could not endure it, and you have heard about it without knowing
              its contention." Pachomius replied, "Do not turn my request, and my
              desire, and do not put off the flame of my zeal. Accept me, be patient
              with me, and examine me, and afterward do whatever you see fit with
              me." The old man told him, "Go, O my son test your self alone for a
              period of time, then come back to me for I am willing to labor with you
              as much as my weakness allows so you might know your own self. The
              monastic piety needs toughness and asceticism, and I will teach you
              first its extent. Then you go and examine your self if you could endure
              the matter or not. My intent in that, God knows, is for the sake of your
              teaching and discipline and not for any other reason. When we, O my
              beloved son, knew the vanity and trickery of this world, we came to this
              distant place, and carried on our shoulders the cross of our Christ, not
              the wooden rod, but the overcoming of the flesh, subduing its lusts, and
              wasting its power. We spent the night praying and glorifying God. Often
              we vigil from sun set till the morning praying and working much with our
              hands, making either ropes, braid palm fibers, weave palm leaves or hair
              to resist sleep and to have what our bodies need and to feed the poor as
              the apostle said, ''remember the needy.'' We entirely do not know the
              eating of oil, cooked food or drinking liquors. We fast till the evening
              of the summer days, and two days at a time during the winter then we
              break the fast by eating only bread and salt. We keep away the boredom
              by remembering death, and how close it is. We refute every pride and
              exaltation and guard ourselves from evil thoughts by humility and piety.
              By this ascetic strive that is accomplished by the grace of God, we
              offer our souls a living sacrifice, acceptable to God, not only once but
              many times. For according to the strive and how much we exert ourselves
              in it, we realize spiritual gifts, remembering the saying of the Lord,
              "Those overcame themselves, seize the Kingdom of Heaven." When
              Pachomius heard from Abba Palamon these sayings that he never heard
              before, he was more assured by the spirit, and was encouraged on facing
              the hardships and endure the pains. He replied saying, "I am confident
              in the Lord Christ first, and by the support of your prayers second, I
              would be able to fulfill all the precepts, and persevere with you till
              death." Pachomius then kneeled before him and kissed his hand. The old
              man preached him and instructed him about the importance of mortifying
              the flesh, the humility and contrition of the heart. He told him, "If
              you kept what I told you, did not go back, or vacillate between two
              opinions, we will rejoice with you." Then he told him, "Do you think
              my son that by all what I mentioned to you from asceticism, praying,
              watching and fasting we ask for the glory of men, no my son, it is not
              like that. We lead you to the works of salvation so we would be
              blameless, for it is written every apparent thing is light, and we must
              through many tribulations enter the kingdom of heaven. Now go back to
              your abode so you might examine your self and test her for few days for
              what you are asking is not an easy task." Pachomius answered him
              saying, "I have examined myself in every thing, and I hope with the
              Grace of God and your holy prayers, that your heart would be pleased
              toward me." The old man answered, "Well." Anba Palamon accepted him
              with joy, then left him for ten days testing him in prayer, watching and
              fasting. Three month later and after he tested his patience, endurance,
              strife and will, he prayed over him, clipped off his hair, and put on
              him the garb of the monks (El-Eskeem) in year 34 A.D. They persevered
              together on asceticism and prayer as they worked in their spare times in
              weaving hair and knitting clothes to gain their bare necessities, and
              what they spared they gave to the needy. Whenever they were vigilance
              and the sleep overcame them, they went out their cells and moved sand
              from one place to another to exhaust their bodies and remove the sleep
              away from them. The old man went on preaching the young man and
              encouraging him saying, "Be courageous O Pachomius, let your devotion
              to God always be flamed with the fire of love, and be before Him, in
              fear, humility, and persevering in praying and kneeling without boredom.
              Be watchful lest the tempter examine you and grief you." It came in the
              biography of St. Pachomius in a manuscript in the monastery of
              El-Baramous the following: One day someone knocked on the door of Sts.
              Palamon and Pachomius to visit them, and he spent the night with them.
              The pride and self-reliance had overcome that person. While they were
              talking about the words of God and before them was fire, for it was
              winter, the guest told them, "Whoever of you has strong faith in God,
              let him rise up, stand on this blazing embers, and recite the prayer
              which the Lord had taught to His disciples." When the old man St.
              Palamon heard that, he admonished him saying, "Cursed is the defiled
              devil who planted this thought in your heart. so stop talking." The
              guest did not head to the words of the old man and said, "I, I would."
              He rose up and stood on the blazing coal while saying the Lord''s prayer
              slowly. Then he stepped out the fire which did not touch his body with
              any harm, and went to his abode with arrogance. Pachomius told Anba
              Palamon, "God knows that I marveled about this brother who stood on the
              amber and his feet did not burn." The old man replied saying, "Do not
              be amazed for there is no doubt that this from the work of the Devil.
              The Lord had allowed his feet not to be burned as it is written to the
              crooked, God sends crooked ways. Believe me O my son, if you know the
              torment that is prepared for him, you will be weeping for his
              wretchedness." The Devil came to this man in the form of a woman and
              enticed him to allow her to enter his cell. Because of the pride and the
              blindness of his perception, he did not realize the danger that
              surrounded him. The lust filled his heart toward her, and immediately
              the devil struck and threw him on the ground and he remained as a dead
              man for a day. When he regained his conscious and his faculties, he went
              to Abba Palamon weeping and remorseful for what he had done. He asked
              for their help and prayers for the devil had captivated him by his own
              free will. While he was talking to them, the old man and his disciple
              were weeping, the evil spirit suddenly came over him. He went to the
              mountain, and he lost his mind. He was astray for a period of time, then
              he threw himself in a fire which burned him. When the old man knew that,
              he was grieved. His disciple asked him, "How God allowed this to happen
              to him after he confessed and asked for repentance with tears and
              remorse." The Abba answered, "God with His foreknowledge knew that the
              repentance of this brother was not sincere, so He allowed him to reap
              what he did." While St. Pachomius was still staying with his teacher
              Anba Palamon, one day he was wondering in the wilderness, and he came to
              the village of Tabanseen. When he was praying, the angel of the Lord
              appeared and told him, "O Pachomius, with the order of the Lord, build
              a monastery in the spot that your are standing on, hence many will come
              to you seeking monasticism." He returned to the old man Anba Palamon
              and told him what the angel had told him, and his intention of
              fulfilling the Will of God. Anba Palamon was sad for the departure of
              his disciple and said, "How could you leave me after seven years you
              spent with me in obedience and submission and I am an old man. I see
              that it is easier on me to accompany you than you leaving me." They
              moved south until they came to Tabanseen, and started to build a
              monastery. That was in the year 311 A.D., and Pachomius was thirty years
              old. When they finished building the monastery, Anba Palamon told his
              disciple Pachomius, "My beloved son I long to return to my cell and the
              place of my solitude. I had known that God had appointed you to
              establish this monastery, which will grow and be filled with God
              pleasing monks. You shall receive power and long suffering to manage
              them. As of my self, I have became old, weak, and the time of my
              departure had drew near. So I see that my solitary life is best for me.
              Nevertheless, I ask from your kindness that you do not deprive me from
              seeing you from now and then. I shall come to visit you as the few days
              left for me allow." They were separated after they prayed with each
              other, and they visited each other. In one of the visits of Anba
              Palamon, he became ill and departed to the Lord that he served and loved
              since his young age. Anba Pachomius took the blessings of his teacher,
              shrouded and buried him. Many wonders and miracles have been attributed
              to this saint. An ancient church in his name is located in the town of
              El-Kasre and El-Sayad in a monastery named after him which had other
              churches in the name of the Virgin St. Mary, the archangel Michael, St.
              Mercurius Abu-Saifain, and St. Demianah. A great festival celebration is
              celebrated annually in his feast day. May his prayers be with us and
              Glory be to God forever. Amen. _________________________________________
              17 The biography of St. Pachomius is under the fourteenth day of Bashans
              (Vol. III, P. 430). 18 When Constantine the Great was victorious,
              Pachomius'' military detachment returned to its post in Upper Egypt, and
              the soldiers were released to return to their hometown. St. Pachomius
              arrived to his town Chinu, and met its priest and asked him to join him
              to the congregation of his church. Since Pachomius was pagan as his
              parents, the priest wrote his name among the catechumens, but God
              inspired the priest to accept him among the believers. He baptized him
              in Maundy thursday, year 31 A.D., and he was twenty years old. He grew
              in virtues, ministering to the believers, and loving the people, until
              his merits became well known. Many people gathered around him. When an
              epidemic spread in this village, he served them, and brought them wood
              from far distances. The Lord had mercy on him and saved him from the
              epidemic, and remained three years visiting the orphans, and the widows,
              ministering to their needs, keeping himself from the defilement of the
              world.'

              وتعلم علوم الفلك وكان يشتهي أن يكون مسيحيا فاتفق له أن وجد راهبا فارسيا
              في السوق اسمه أوغالس فعرف منه طريق الله وابتهج جدا حتى أنه كان يعظ أهل
              بيته ويعلمهم ما يسهل لهم طريق الإيمان . ثم اعتمد وترهب وصار يعمل أعمالا

              رسموه شماسا وفيما هو يخدم مع القس المتوحد في الهيكل رأي حمامة بيضاء حسنة

          english: 6. The Martyrdom of St. Abakragoun.
          arabic: 8. نياحة القديس بلامون أب الرهبان
      text:
          english: On this day also, St. Abakragoun, who was from El-Batanoon, was
              martyred. He was formerly a thief. Two young men plotted with him to
              steal. They went to the cell of a monk, and they found him keeping a
              vigil, praying. They waited until he had finished his prayer and had
              lain down. Nevertheless, he remained standing praying until they became
              weary and troubled. At dawn, the old monk went out to the thieves, and
              when they saw him they bowed down before him, and cast down their
              swords. He preached to them, taught them, and they became monks under
              his direction. St. Abakragoun fought a very great fight, and devoted
              himself to the ascetic life. The old monk prophesied to him that he
              would receive the crown of martyrdom for the Name of Christ, and his
              saying was fulfilled later on. Six years latter the devil incited
              persecution against the church, St. Abakragoun bid his spiritual father
              farewell and took his blessings. He went to Nakios, and confessed the
              Name of the Lord Christ before the governor, who was appointed by
              Maximianus Caesar. The governor tortured him much and then took him to
              Alexandria. Then he was tortured by hanging him on the mast of the ship
              five times, and each time the ropes broke. Then they placed him in a
              sack made of hide, and threw him into the sea. The angel of the Lord
              brought him out of the water, and commanded him to go to Samanoud. On
              his way he passed by the city of El-Benwan, and its people recognized
              him. They brought to him everyone who had an infirmity and they were
              healed by his prayers. When he arrived at Samanoud, God wrought on his
              hands many signs. He raised, by his prayers, the daughter of Justus the
              Vizier from the dead. Justus, his wife, and all his soldiers, believed,
              and they all received the crown of martyrdom, and they were numbered,
              nine hundred thirty-five men. As for St. Abakragoun, they sent him back
              to Alexandria. After they tortured him with different kinds of tortures,
              they cut off his head, and he received the crown of martyrdom. The angel
              of the Lord appeared to a priest from the city of Menuf, told him about
              the place of the body of the saint, and the priest went and took it.
              After the end of the time of persecution, they built a church in his
              name in the city of El-Batanoon, and placed his body in it. May his
              prayers be with us. Amen.
          arabic: 'في مثل هذا اليوم من سنة 316 م تنيح القديس أنبا بلامون السائح كان سائحا
              في الجبل الشرقي في بلدة القصر والصياد من أعمال مركز نجع حمادى بمحافظة
              قنا . وقد تعب الشيطان فيما نصبه لهذا الأب من الشراك فلم يقدر عليه حتى
              اضطر هذا الشرير أن ينتهز فرصة أخري لينصب له فخاخه ففي أحد الأيام قام رجل
              الله أنبا بلامون وحمل عمله القليل الذي أعده واتجه نح وريف مصر . وبينما
              كان يمشي في الطريق وه ويبكي علي خطاياه أضله عد والخير في الجبل فظل سبعة
              أيام حتى قارب الموت من الجوع والعطش وقد كان الوقت صيفا . وأخيرا وقع علي
              الأرض مغشيا عليه يطلب الموت . فأراد الله محب البشر أن لا يترك عبده أنبا
              بلامون يقع فريسة الشيطان فأمره بتركه ولما أدرك الشيخ ذلك صرخ قائلا:"
              يا ربي يسوع المسيح أعني " وللوقت سمع صوتا يقول له لا تخف فان العد ولا
              يقدر أن يقوى عليك . قم وامش قليلا إلى القبلي فانك تجد شيخا راهبا صديقا
              اسمه أنبا تلاصون وه وفي قلعة وأعلمه بكل شيء جري لك من الشيطان وبالخطية
              العظيمة التي جربك بها في عهد صباك وه ويصلي من أجلك فتغفر لك كل خطاياك
              حينئذ قام الطوباوي أنبا بلامون وحمل عمل يده القليل وسار في الجبل وه ويتل
              والمزمور الثالث والخمسين قائلا:الهم باسمك خلصني وبقوتك احكم لي اسمع
              يارب صلاتي وأنصت إلى كلام فمي فان الغرباء قد قاموا علي وجماعة الأقوياء
              طلبوا نفسي لم يجعلوا الله أمامهم فهوذا الله معين لي ، الرب ناصر نفسي يرد
              الشر علي أعدائي بحقك استأصلهم فاذبح لك طائع ، واعترف لاسمك يارب فانه
              صالح لأنك من كل حزن نجيتني وبأعدائي نظرت عيناي ثم قال أيضا:يقوم الله
              يتبدد جميع أعدائه ويهرب مبغضوه من أمام وجهه كما يباد الدخان يبادون ، كما
              يذوب الشمع أمام وجه النار . كذلك تهلك الخطاة أمام الله والصديقون يفرحون
              يتهللون أمام الله ويتنعمون بالسرور " ولم يفتر عن الصلاة حتى هداه الله
              إلى مكان الشيخ . فلما نظره أنبا تلاصون فرح جدا وحياه وأمسكه وأصعده علي
              الصخرة ثم صليا وجلسا يتحدثان بعظائم الله وقد استقصي منه أنبا تلاصون عن
              كيفية معرفته الطريق حتى جاء إليه ليفتقده في هذه البرية حينئذ بدأ القديس
              أنبا بلامون يبكي وسجد قائلا اغفر لي يا أبي الحبيب القديس فقال له أنبا
              تلاصون:الرب يسوع المسيح يغفر لنا جميعا كل زلاتنا . فأجابه الشيخ البار
              أنبا بلامون قائلا:إني أستحي أن أعرفك يا أبي القديس العظيم بالخطية
              الكبرى التي أدركتني من قبل الشيطان ولم أعلم فقال أنبا تلاصون " مكتوب
              هكذا:اعترفوا بخطاياكم بعضكم لبعض فقال أنبا بلامون:وأنا يا أبى القديس
              قد صنعت أيضا خطايا عظيمة في صباي والي الآن فإني أخطئ كل يوم من أجل هذا
              أتيت إليك في هذه البرية اسأل الله بدموع حتى يغفر لي لأنه رؤوف رحيم
              وأرادته الرحمة لأنه اله محب البشر يستطيع أن يغفر لنا خطايانا وه وإذا غفر
              الخطية فلا نعود نخطئ مرة أخري . ولما نظر القديس بلامون أن الطوباوي أنبا
              تلاصون يعزيه بالتوبة تعزي بكلامه وبدأ يقول له:هذا كان مني مرة واحدة
              وأنا في دير الرهبان أسال الله تعالي أن يغفر لي خطاياي فسمعتهم يقولون في
              الكتب المقدسة التي هي من نفحات روح الله . ان الوحدة تلد الخوف وأن الله
              يبغض الاستهزاء والضحك بغير موجب فوضعت في قلبي أن أتوحد في مسكني الصغير
              ولا أتكلم مع أحد ولا أضحك البتة بل أبكي علي خطاياي الليل والنهار وكان
              الشيطان في مرات كثيرة يقاتلني ويطيب قلبي بالضحك فلا أسمع منه ولا أشتم
              البتة وكان يضع أمامي ألعابا مضحكة لكي أضحك فلا أصغي له بل كنت أنحني
              وأبكي علي خطاياي متمسكا بالخلاص الذي لربنا يسوع المسيح وبقيت أجاهد زمانا
              طويلا في الأتعاب حتى غضب علي العد ووعندما قمت ذات يوم أحمل عمل يدي وسرت
              في الجبل لأمضي لأبيعه واشتري قليلا من الخبز وبعدما بعدت عن مسكني قليلا
              جذبني الشيطان نحوه وللوقت أضل عقلي وانتزع اسم ربي من فمي ولم اعد انطق
              بالأقوال الإلهية . ورأيت الجبل كله قد تغير في وجهي وصارت الأرض الرملية
              أرضا سوداء ولما تطلعت أمامي رأيت مدينة جديدة حسنة المباني تحوي بيوتا
              عظيمة القدر وقصورا فخمة وأبوابا مصفحة تبرق جيدا وكانت تلك المدينة حصينة
              كأنها مدينة الملك والأشجار والبساتين محيطة بها . ولما شاهدتها تعجبت لهذه
              المدينة ولعظم كرامتها ، ولما انحرفت للدخول فيها قلت لعل أهلها يشترون مني
              عمل يدي القليل فلما وصلت بجوار أسوارها وجدت ساقية تدور ونظرت امرأة حزينة
              وجهها مكتئب جدا وثيابها ممزقة ومنديلها يغطي عينيها من أجل الحشمة وهي
              جالسة علي البئر وتدير الساقية وتسقي الكروم فلما نظرتني جلست وغطت رأسها
              وقالت:بارك علي يا أبي القديس فأسرعت ووضعت القفف أمامي ثم قالت:اقعد
              واسترح يا أبي الحبيب لأنك تعبت من حملك وحينئذ أجلستني علي مجري ماء وصارت
              تأخذ من الماء يكفيها وتسكبه علي رجلي ، وتغسلهما كمثل من يأخذ البركة
              كأنها امرأة إنسان غني . فقلت لها:أيتها المرأة المؤمنة قولي لي إذا أنا
              دخلت هذه المدينة بعمل يدي هذا القليل فهل أجد من يشتريه مني ؟ فقالت:نعم
              يشترونه منك ، ولكن اتركه وأنا أشتريه منك بما أقدر دفعه وأعطيك كل ما
              تحتاجه لأني كنت متزوجة من إنسان غني ومات من عهد قريب وترك لي مالا كثيرا
              ومواشي عديدة وها أنت تري هذه الكروم العظيمة أقوم بقطف ثمرها وليس عندي
              أحد يلاحظها فليتني أجد إنسانا مثلك أسلم له كل مالي ليفعل به ما يشاء .
              فان قبلت يا أبي القديس أن تأتي وتتسلط علي بيتي وتأخذ كل مالي فأنا أتخذك
              لي زوجا . أما أنا فقلت لها:إذا تزوج الراهب يلحقه الخزي والعار حينئذ
              قالت لي المرأة:ان كنت لا تأخذني لك زوجة فكن متوليا علي كل مالي تديره
              أثناء النهار لأني أملك حقولا وأجرانا ومواشي وكروما وعبيدا وجواري فتقوم
              بتدبير العمل في النهار وإذا جاء الليل تقوم بتأدية صلواتك " ثم قامت
              وأصعدتني إلى أعلي دارها وهيأت لي مائدة من جميع الألوان ووضعتها أمامي ثم
              دخلت حجرتها ولبست ثيابا فاخرة وأتت إلى وعانقتني فدهشت لذلك وتمسكت بقوة
              الله العلي ورشمت علي نفسي علامة الصليب فانحل كل ما رأيته كالدخان أمام
              الرياح ولم يبق شيء مما فعلته تلك المرأة . وفي الحال علمت أن ذلك كله كان
              من فعل الشيطان اللعين الذي يريد بذلك إسقاطي في الخطية فبكيت بكاء مرا
              وندمت كثيرا علي ما وقع مني فتحنن علي ربي الكثير الرحمة وأرسل لي ملاكه
              فعزاني ووعدني بغفران خطاياي وقال لي:امض إلى القديس أنبا تلاصون القريب
              منك وأعترف له بخطاياك وقد أتيت إليك أيها القديس لكي بصلواتك يغفر الرب لي
              خطاياي فصلي القديس وقال:يا ولدي الرب يغفر لك ولنا وعند ذلك نزلت لهما
              مائدة من السماء وأكلا ثم عاد إلى معبده بسلام . وكان هذا القديس متزايدا
              في النسك والعبادة مداوما طول أيام حياته علي الصلوات الليلية والنهارية
              ساهرا الليل الطويل في العبادة التقشفية وقد تتلمذ علي يد هذا القديس
              الأنبا باخوميوس أب الشركة الرهبانية . ونال هذا القديس موهبة الشفاء من
              الله وكانت الوحوش تأنس اليه فيطعمها بيده وتلحس قدميه وكان يعيش عاريا
              فأطال الله شعره حتى ستر جسمه كله وكان يصوم أسبوعا أسبوعا ولا يفطر إلا
              يومي السبت والأحد بنصف خبزه يرسلها له الرب مع الغراب وكان يأكل مرارا من
              عشب الجبل ويشرب الماء بمكيال وكان رؤوفا رحيما حنونا متشبها بخالقه وكان
              عندما يحل الليل ينزل من مكان تعبده ويتفقد المساجين والمتضايقين والأيتام
              والأرامل والمنقطعين والغرباء حسب ما تسمح به قوته من ثمن ما تصنعه يداه من
              الأعمال . ولما انتصر قسطنطين الكبير وعادت حملته إلى بلادها بمصر العليا
              وانطلق الجنود إلى بلادهم وصل القديس باخوميوس بلدة شين وفسكيا وقابل
              كاهنها وطلب إليه ضمه إلى شعب كنيسته ولما كان باخوميوس وثنيا كوالديه كتب
              الكاهن اسمه ضمن الموعوظين إلا أن الله تعالي ألهم الكاهن أن يقبله في عداد
              المؤمنين فأخذه وعمده في يوم خميس الفصح المجيد سنة 31 م وكان عمره وقتئذ
              عشرين سنة وكان ينم وفي الفضيلة ومحبة الناس وخدمة المؤمنين حتى ذاعت
              فضائله فالتف حوله شعب كثير واتخذ قريته موطنا له إلى أن حل وباء في تلك
              القرية فكان يقوم بخدمتهم ويحضر لهم الحطب من الأماكن المجاورة حتى تحنن
              الرب ورفع عنه المرض وظل ثلاث سنين يتفقد الأيتام والأرامل ويقضي حاجاتهم
              حافظا نفسه من دنس العالم . وبعد ذلك التمس أن يعيش عيشة الزهد والتقشف
              بعيدا عن العالم فأرشده قس البلدة إلى المتوحد العظيم بلامون وللوقت سلم
              موضعه لشيخ آخر راهب لكي يهتم بأحوال المساكين وقام ومضي إلى الشيخ بلامون
              ولما وصل إليه قرع باب قلايته فتطلع إليه الشيخ من الكوة وقال له:من أنت
              أيها الأخ وماذا تريد ؟ فأجابه مسرعا قائلا:أنا أيها الأب المبارك أطلب
              المسيح الإله الذي أنت تعبده وأرغب إلى أبوتك أن تقبلني إليك وتجعلني راهبا
              . فقال له بلامون الكبير:يا بني ان الرهبنة ليست من الأعمال المطلقة ولا
              يأتي إليها الإنسان كيفما اتفق لأن كثيرين قد التجئوا إليها وهم يجهلون
              أتعابها ولما صاروا فيها لم يستطيعوا الصبر عليها وأنت سمعت عنها دون أن
              تعرف جهادها . فأجابه باخوميوس لا ترد سؤالي ورغبتي ولا تطفئ شعلة نشاطي بل
              اقبلني وتمهل علي وجربني وبعد ذلك افعل بي ما يبد ولك فقال له الشيخ امض يا
              ولدي وجرب نفسك وحدك وقتا ما ثم ارجع إلينا لأني مستعد أن أتعب معك كمقدار
              ضعفي حتى تعرف ذاتك وحدك لان نسك الرهبنة يحتاج إلى خشونة وتقشف وأنا أعلمك
              أولا مقدارها وتمضي بعد ذلك وتجرب نفسك أن كنت تحتمل الآمر أم لا . وقصدي
              في ذلك قد عرفه ربي أنه علي سبيل تعليمك وتثقيفك وليس لشيء آخر ونحن أيها
              الابن الحبيب قضينا كثيرا علي ما عرفنا من الدنيا غرورها وحيلها ووصلنا إلى
              هذا المكان الوحيد والمسكن الفريد وحملنا علي عاتقنا صليب مسيحنا ليس عود
              الخشب بل تذليل الجسد وقمع شهواته وإماتة قواه ونقضي الليل ساهرين نتل
              والصلاة ونمجد الله وقد نسهر مرات كثيرة من وقت العشاء إلى الصباح نعمل
              عملا كثيرا بأيدينا أما حبالا أ وليفا أ وخوصا أ وشعرا لكي نقاتل النوم
              ونقوم بحاجة أجسادنا وإطعام المساكين حسب قول الرسول:" اذكروا المساكين "
              وأما أكل الزيت أ والشيء المطبوخ أ وشرب الخمر فلا نعرفه البتة ونحن نصوم
              إلى المساء في نهار الصيف وفي الشتاء يومين يومين ونفطر علي خبز وملح لا
              غير ونبعد الملل بذكر الموت وقرب الآجل وندحض بالنسك والاتضاع كل تعاظم
              وارتفاع ونحرس أنفسنا من الهواجس الرديئة.وبهذا الجهاد النسكى المكمل
              بمعونة الله جل اسمه نقدم أرواحنا ضحية نقية وذبيحة مرضية ليس دفعة واحدة
              بل دفعات عديدة ،وذلك حسب الجهاد ومقدار ما نبذله فيه لتحققنا ان المواهب
              الروحية توزع علي قدر الأتعاب الجسدية ذاكرين قول الإله:" ان الذين
              يقهرون ذاوتهم يختطفون ملكوت السموات " . فلما سمع باخوميوس من بلامون
              الشيخ هذه الأقوال التي لم يسمع مثلها قبلا تأكد بالروح أكثر وتشجع علي
              مباشرة الأتعاب ومكابدة الآلام وأجابه قائلا " أنى ثقة بالمسيح الإله أولا
              وبمؤازرة صلواتك ثانيا أقوي علي تأدية جميع الفروض واصبر معك حتي الممات "
              . عند ذلك سجد أمامه وقبل يديه فوعظه الشيخ وعرفه بضرورة العمل علي إماتة
              الجسد وتواضع القلب وانسحاقه وقال له " ان أنت حفظت ما قلته لك ولم ترجع
              إلى خلف ولم تكن ذا قلبين فأننا نفرح معك " ثم قال له:" أتظن يا بني أن
              جميع ما ذكرته لك من نسك وصلاة وسهر وخلافه نطلب به مجد البشر ، كلا يا
              ولدى ليس الآمر كذلك . ا وتظن إننا نهدد الناس ؟ ليس الآمر كذلك أيضا بل
              نحن نعرفك بعمل الخلاص لنكون بغير لوم لأنه قد كتب ان كل شيء ظاهر فه
              ونور،لأنه بضيقات كثيرة ندخل ملكوت السموات . والآن ارجع إلى مسكنك حتى
              تمتحن نفسك وتجربها أياما ،فليس ما تطلبه آمرا هينا " فأجابه باخوميوس "قد
              أتممت تجربة نفسي في كل شيء ، وأنا أرج وبمعونة الله وبصلواتك المقدسة ،ان
              يستريح قلبك من جهتي .فأجابه الشيخ حسناً . وقبله بفرح ثم تركه عشرة أيام
              وه ويجربه في الصلاة وفي السهر وفي الصوم وبعد ثلاثة اشهر ، لما اختبر صبره
              واجتهاده وعزيمته ، صلى عليه وقص شعره والبسه أسيم الرهبان في سنة 34م ،
              وصار يواظبون على النسك والصلاة ، كما ظلا يشتغلان في أوقات الفراغ بغزل
              الشعر ونسج الملابس وينالان من ذلك الحاجة الضرورية ، وما افضل عنهما
              يقدمانه المساكين . وكانا إذا سهرا وغلبا النوم يخرجان معا خارج قلاليهما
              ينقلان رملا من مكان لأخر ليتبعا جسديهما ويطردا النوم عنهما . وكان الشيخ
              يداوم على عظة الشاب وتشجيعه ويقول له:"تشجع يا باخوميوس وليكن تعلقك
              بالله متوقدا بنار المحبة على الدوام وكن امامه ورعا متواضعا مواظبا على
              الصلاة بلا ملل ، مواصلا السجود بلا كلل . يقظا ساهرا حذرا لئلا يمتحنك
              المجرب ويحزنك ". وجاء فى سيرة القديس باخوميوس المخطوطة بدير البراموس
              مايأتى:" وفى بعض الأيام طرق باب القديس بلامون وباخوميوس أحد الاخوة
              زائر ، وكان ممن قد غلب عليه الكبرياء والاعتداد بالذات فبات عندهما ،
              وفيما هما يتحدثان أقوال الله وأمامهما نار تشتعل ، لان الوقت كان شتاء ،
              قال الأخ الضيف لهما:"من منكما له إيمان قوى بالله ، فلينهض وليقف على
              هذا الجمر ، ويتل والصلاة التي علمها الرب لتلاميذه .فلما سمع الشيخ ذلك
              زجره قائلا:" ملعون هو الشيطان النجس الذي ألقي هذا الفكر في قلبك فاكفف
              عن الكلام " فلم يحفل الأخ بقول الشيخ ، ولكنه قال "أنا .أنا.ثم نهض قائما
              وانتصب على ذلك الجمر المتقد وهو يقول الصلاة الإنجيلية مهلا .مهلا .، وخرج
              من النار ولم تعمل فى جسده شيء البتة . وبعد ذلك مضى إلى مسكنه بكبرياء .
              فقال باخوميوس للشيخ بلامون:"الرب يعرف إنني تعجبت من هذا الأخ ، الذي
              وقف على الجمر ولم تحترق قدماه " . فأجابه الشيخ:" لا تعجب يا بني من هذا
              ، لأنه بلا شك من فعل الشيطان فقد سمح الرب أن لا تحترق قدماه كما هو مكتوب
              أن الله يرسل للمعوجين طرقا معوجة صدقني يا بني أنك لوكنت تعلم بالعذاب
              المعد له لكنت تبكي علي شقائه " وبعد أيام قلائل وهوفي كبريائه رأي الشيطان
              أنه علي استعداد لقبول خداعه فجاء اليه بصورة امرأة جميلة الدلال حلوة
              المقال متزينة بثياب زاهية وقناعات فاخرة وقرعت بابه ففتح لها حينئذ أسفرت
              وجهها وقالت له:اعلم أيها الأب الخير أن علي دينا لقوم وهم الآن يطلبونه
              وأنا في هذا الوقت لا يمكنني وفاؤه وأخشى أن يقبضوا علي عنوة ويأخذوني إلى
              ديارهم عبدة لهم لأنهم مسافرون فاعمل معي جميلا لا مكث عندك يوما واحدا أ
              ويومين علي الأكثر لكي أتخلص منهم وتنال من الله جزيل الآجر ومني أنا
              المسكينة صالح الذكر . أما هو فلأجل عمي بصيرته وكبرياء قلبه لم يحس
              بالبلاء الذي دبر له فأدخلها إلى قلايته واتكأها علي وسادته . حينئذ امتلأ
              قلبه من الشهوة نحوها وللوقت باغته الشيطان وصرعه علي الأرض وبقي كالميت
              يوما وليلة . وبعد ذلك عاوده رشده ورجع إليه عقله فقام وجاء إلى الشيخ
              بلامون باكيا نادما علي ما حدث وقال:ان سبب هلاكي وعلة مماتي هو أنني لم
              أصغ إلى ردعك إياي والآن أرجو أن تعاضدني وتؤازرني لأني صرت أسيرا للشيطان
              برغبتي وعندما كان يعدد هذه الأقوال والشيخ وتلميذه يبكيان لمصابه باغته
              الروح النجس فمضي إلى الجبل وقطع مسافة بعيدة حتى بلغ مدينة بانوس وبقي
              تائها فاقد العقل وقتا ما وأخيرا زج بنفسه في أتون متقد فاحترق فيه ولما
              عرف الأب الكبير ما آل إليه حاله وكيف كانت وفاته حزن جدا وقال:لعلي كمن
              يجهل هذه الأمور ثم تساءل تلميذه وقال:كيف فعل له سبحانه ما فعل بعد
              الاعتراف الحسن وطلبه التوبة بندم وخشوع ؟ فأجابه الأب قائلا ان الله تبارك
              اسمه – يسابق علمه – علم أن توبة هذا الأخ لم تكن صادقة فأوقعه فيما فعل.
              ولما كان باخوميوس يسعى في البرية عندما كان يصلي ظهر له ملاك مقدس وقال له
              بأمر الرب يا باخوميوس ، عمر ديرا في البقعة التي أنت واقف عليها برجليك
              حيث سيأتي إليك جمع غفير طالبين الرهبنة فعاد إلى الشيخ وأعلمه بكلام
              الملاك وعزمه علي تنفيذ إرادة اله فحزن بلامون لمفارقته وقال كيف بعد سبع
              سنين مكثتها معي بطاعة وخضوع تفارقني عند كبري أني أري أن ذهابي معك أسهل
              علي من مفارقتك ". فانتقلا إلى قبلي وبلغا طبانسين وشرعا في إقامة دير وذلك
              في سنة 311 م وكان عمر باخوميوس وقتئذ ثلاثين سنة . ولما فرغا من إنشاء
              الدير قال الشيخ بلامون لتلميذه باخوميوس:" أعلم أيها الابن الحبيب
              والشخص الكريم أن نفسي تنازعني بالعودة إلى قلايتي ومكان توحدي وقد عرفت أن
              الله قد قلدك تعمير هذا الدير وأنه سينمو ويمتلئ من الرهبان المرضيين لله
              وأنت عتيد أن تستمد من الله قوة وطول روح علي سياستهم . أما أنا فلقد طعنت
              في السن وضعفت قوتي وحان وقت انطلاقي وأري أن توحدي هو الأوفق لي . ولكني
              التمس من بنوتك وأطلب من خالص محبتك أن لا تحرمني من رؤياك من وقت لآخر ،
              وأنا سأقوم بزيارتك إذا سمحت الأيام اليسيرة التي تبقت لي . ثم افترقا بعد
              أن صليا وصارا يتزاوران ، وفي إحدى الزيارات مرض الشيخ بلامون المرض الذي
              انتقل فيه إلى الرب الذي خدمه منذ نعومة أظفاره فكفنه باخوميوس بعد أن تزود
              ببركاته . وتذكر لهذا القديس عجائب كثيرة كما توجد علي اسمه أيضا كنيسة
              أثرية في بلدة القصر والصياد في دير يحمل اسمه به عدة كنائس غيرها علي اسم
              القديس مرقوريوس أبي سيفين ويقام له احتفال عظيم في عيده وأخري علي اسم
              العذراء القديسة مريم والشهيدة دميانه والملاك ميخائيل . صلاته تكون معنا .
              ولربنا المجد دائما . آمين'

          arabic: 9. استشهاد القديس أباكراجون
      text:
          english: 'This day also, marks the martyrdom of St. Domadius El-Souriani (The
              Syrian). He was brought up in Persia, and learned Astrology, and wished
              to become Christian. One day he found a Persian monk in the market,
              whose name was Aughalis, who taught him the way of God and he rejoiced
              exceedingly. He began to preach to the people of his house, and to teach
              them what might facilitate them to the path of Faith. Then he was
              baptized, and became a monk. He performed many great deeds that the
              brethren were jealous of him. When he felt that, he left them and went
              to the monastery of St. Sergius. There he lived with a hermit for ten
              years during which he did not eat any cooked food. Then they ordained
              him a deacon. While he was ministering with the hermit priest in the
              sanctuary, he saw a white dove of most beautiful appearance, which came
              down and descended upon the altar. Domadius thought that it was a real
              dove, so he made a motion with his hand to drive the dove off, for he
              was worried about the content of the chalice. After the service was
              ended, the priest asked him, "What did disturb you during the
              liturgy?" Domadius told him what he had seen. The priest told him, "If
              you see the dove again tell me." In the next day, the priest went up to
              the altar to celebrate the liturgy as usual, and when Domadius saw the
              dove, he told the priest, "My father the dove has come." The priest
              looked around but he could not see anything. He bowed his head before
              God with weeping and prayer by day and night for a period of time, until
              he was worthy to see this dove. He realized that this was the sign of
              the Holy Spirit. He did not say anything to St. Domadius lest pride fill
              his heart, but he told the bishop who had ordained him a priest. When
              the news of his holiness reached the patriarch of this area, he wished
              to visit him. When St. Domadius knew of this, he fled from there and
              came to the church of St. Cosmas, where he lived for a while nearby,
              feeding on the vegetation of the earth. God wrought on his hand many
              signs and miracles. When Emperor Julian went out to fight against the
              Persians, he passed by the cave of this saint. They told him about the
              saint, so he ordered him stoned. The soldiers stoned him and his
              disciple, until a great heap of stones stood over the cave. Many years
              later, God revealed his body, a church was built for him and God
              manifested many wonders in it. May his prayers be with us. Amen. 8. The
              Consecration of the Church of St. Mercurius. Today also the church
              celebrates the commemoration of the consecration of the church of the
              great St. Mercurius Abu-Saifain. The biography of his life is written
              under the twenty- fifth day of the month of Hatour. May his blessing be
              with us. Amen. 9. The Departure of St. Palamon, the Father of the Monks.
              On this day also, of the year 316 A.M., the saint Anba Palamon the
              anchorite, departed. He was an anchorite in the Eastern Mount in a town
              called El-Kasre and El-Sayad, district of Nagaa-Hammady, governorate of
              Quena. The Devil was weary of tempting this father, and failed to
              overcome him. The Devil took every chance to direct his snares against
              him. One day, the man of God Anba Palamon rose up, took the work of his
              hand, and walked toward the countryside of Egypt. While he was walking
              in his way, he was weeping for his sins. The enemy of the good led him
              astray in the mountain, for seven days, until he was close to death from
              hunger and thirst, for it was summer. Finally, he collapsed, fell on the
              ground, wishing to die. God, the lover of mankind, wished not to leave
              His servant Anba Palamon fall prey to the devil, so He ordered the devil
              to leave him. When the old man realized that, he cried saying, "O Lord
              Jesus Christ help me." Instantly he heard a voice saying to him, "Do
              not be afraid, for the enemy can not overcome you. Rise and walk a short
              distance to the south. You shall find a righteous old monk whose name is
              Talasoun. Tell him about all that the devil has brought on you, and the
              grievous sin that he tempted you with in your young age. He will pray on
              your behalf so that your sins will be forgiven." The blessed Anba
              Palamon rose up, carried the works of his hands, and walked in the mount
              reciting Psalm fifty four, "Save me, O God, by Your name, And vindicate
              me by Your strength. Hear my prayer, O God; Give ear to the words of my
              mouth. For strangers have risen up against me, And oppressors have
              sought after my life; They have not set God before them. Behold, God is
              my helper; The Lord is with those who uphold my life. He will repay my
              enemies for their evil. Cut them off in Your truth. I will freely
              sacrifice to You; I will praise Your name, O LORD, for it is good. For
              He has delivered me out of all trouble; And my eye has seen its desire
              upon my enemies." He also recited Psalms 68, "Let God arise, Let His
              enemies be scattered; Let those also who hate Him flee before Him. As
              smoke is driven away, So drive them away; As wax melts before the fire,
              So let the wicked perish at the presence of God. But let the righteous
              be glad; Let them rejoice before God; Yes, let them rejoice
              exceedingly." He did not cease praying until God guided him to the
              place of Anba Talasoun. When Anba Talasoun saw him, he rejoiced
              exceedingly, greeted him, held his hand and pulled him up the rock where
              he lived. They prayed, then sat down talking about the greatness of God.
              Anba Talasoun asked Anba Palamon about how he found his way to come to
              visit him in this wilderness. Then Anba Palamon started crying and
              kneeled, saying, "Please forgive me O my beloved holy father." Anba
              Talasoun said, "The Lord Jesus Christ forgives to all of us all our
              transgressions." Anba Palamon replied saying, "I am ashamed to tell
              you, O my holy father, about the enormous sin that befell me by the
              Devil without knowing." Anba Talasoun told him, "It is written
              ''Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that you
              may be healed.''" When Anba Palamon saw that the blessed Anba Talasoun
              was comforting and encouraging him, he started to tell him, "While I
              was living in the monastery, I asked God to forgive me my sins. I also
              read in the holy books of the fathers which are inspired by the Spirit
              of God, that solitary life brings forth the fear of God, and God
              despises mockery and laughing for no reason. So I decided to live a
              solitary life in my small home, to not talk to anyone, and never to
              laugh, but to cry on my sins by day and night. The Devil often fought
              against me. He tried to please my heart with laughter but I did not heed
              him, and I never cursed. I fought for a long time through these
              tribulations, steadfast in the salvation of our Lord Christ until the
              enemy was wrath with me. One day I took the work of my hands, walked in
              the mount to go to sell it and buy a little of bread. After I was at a
              considerable distance from my abode, the Devil captivated me, and right
              away I lost my mind. He removed the Name of God from my mouth and I was
              no longer reciting the Divine sayings. The mount changed entirely before
              me, the sandy earth became black. When I looked before me I saw a new
              city, had splendid buildings, magnificent houses, rich palaces, and the
              city had shining armored gat which was fortified as a city of a king,
              surrounded by trees and gardens. When I saw it, I wondered about this
              city and its great distinction."When I inclined to enter the city
              thinking that its people might buy from me the work of my hands. As I
              came close to the walls of the city, I found a turning water wheel
              (sakieh), and I saw a sorrowful woman. Her face was very gloomy. Her
              clothes were torn and her veil covered her eyes for the sake of decency.
              She was standing beside the well, running the water wheel and watering
              the vines. When she saw me, she sat down, covered her head and said,
              ''Bless me O my holy father.'' In hast she put down the baskets before me
              then said, ''Sit down and rest O my beloved father for you had become
              tired from what you have carried.'' She sat me down beside running water,
              she took water in her hands, poured it on my feet, and washed them as
              someone taking blessings. She acted as a woman of a rich man. I asked
              her, ''O faithful woman, tell me, if I enter this city with the work of
              my hands would I find one who would buy it from me?'' She said, ''Yes,
              they would buy it from you. Nevertheless, leave it and I will buy it
              from you, and I will give you all that you need. For I was married to a
              rich man who died recently and left me much money and herds of cattle. I
              pick the fruits of these enormous vines, and I do not have anyone to
              oversee it. I wish to have a man like you, to whom I can hand all my
              possessions, to handle the way he sees fit. So if you accept, O my holy
              father, to come and oversee my house and to take charge of all my
              possessions, I will take you as a husband.'' I replied, ''If the monk gets
              married, shame and disgrace follow him.'' Then the woman told me, ''If you
              do not take me as a wife, be an overseer for my possessions. You
              supervise it during the day, for I own fields, cattle, barns, vineyards,
              slaves and maiden servants, and when the night falls you shall fulfill
              your prayers.'' Then she rose up, and took me to her house. She prepared
              a table of different kinds of foods and placed it before me. Afterwards,
              she went to her room, and put on expensive and extravagant clothes, then
              came and embraced me. I was surprised and I held fast to the power of
              God almighty, and crossed myself with the sign of the cross. All that I
              saw immediately vanished as the smoke before the winds, and nothing of
              what this woman did remained. "Instantly, I realized that all of this
              was the doing of the Devil who wished to make me fall in sin. I cried
              bitterly, and regretted much what I had done. The Lord had compassion on
              me with His tender mercy, and sent me His angel who comforted me, and
              promised the forgiveness of my sins and told me, ''Go to the saint Anba
              Talasoun who is nearby you, and confess to him your sins. Tell him that
              you have come to him so that the Lord may forgive your sins through his
              prayers.''" The saint Anba Talasoun prayed saying, "O my son may the
              Lord forgive you and myself." Subsequently, a table came down from
              heaven, they ate, then Anba Palamon returned to his place of worship in
              peace. This Saint received the gift of healing from God. The beasts were
              friendly to him, he fed them by his hands, and they licked his feet. He
              lived naked, so God lengthened his hair until it covered his whole body.
              He fasted the whole week, only ate on Saturday and Sunday. He ate a half
              loaf of bread that God sent him with the raven. Often he ate from the
              vegetation of the mount. He was merciful, compassionate, and tender like
              His creator. When the night fell, he went down from his place of
              worship, to visit the prisoners, orphans, widowers, those in trouble,
              and the sojourners, as his strength allowed him, to help them from the
              price of the works of his hands. St. Palamon was fervent in his
              asceticism and worship. He persevered, all the days of his life, in the
              daily and nightly prayers, and watching all night in ascetic worships.
              St. Pachomius17, the father of the monastic cenobite, was the disciple
              of this saint. When St. Pachomius18 rejected paganism and adopted
              Christianity, he wished to live a life of asceticism and worship, so the
              priest of his hometown directed him to go to the great hermit Anba
              Palamon. Pachomius handed the care for the poor and the needy in his
              town to another elder monk, and went to Anba Palamon. When he arrived,
              he knocked the door of his cell. The old man looked from an aperture and
              asked him, "Who are you O brother? and what do you want?" Pachomius
              answered hastily, "I, O blessed father, looking for the Christ the God
              Whom you do worship, and I beg your fatherhood to accept me and to make
              me a monk." Abba Palamon told him, "O my son, monasticism is not an
              unrestricted labor, and the man does not come into it as he pleases, for
              many had adopted it not knowing its hardships, and when they adopted it
              they could not endure it, and you have heard about it without knowing
              its contention." Pachomius replied, "Do not turn my request, and my
              desire, and do not put off the flame of my zeal. Accept me, be patient
              with me, and examine me, and afterward do whatever you see fit with
              me." The old man told him, "Go, O my son test your self alone for a
              period of time, then come back to me for I am willing to labor with you
              as much as my weakness allows so you might know your own self. The
              monastic piety needs toughness and asceticism, and I will teach you
              first its extent. Then you go and examine your self if you could endure
              the matter or not. My intent in that, God knows, is for the sake of your
              teaching and discipline and not for any other reason. When we, O my
              beloved son, knew the vanity and trickery of this world, we came to this
              distant place, and carried on our shoulders the cross of our Christ, not
              the wooden rod, but the overcoming of the flesh, subduing its lusts, and
              wasting its power. We spent the night praying and glorifying God. Often
              we vigil from sun set till the morning praying and working much with our
              hands, making either ropes, braid palm fibers, weave palm leaves or hair
              to resist sleep and to have what our bodies need and to feed the poor as
              the apostle said, ''remember the needy.'' We entirely do not know the
              eating of oil, cooked food or drinking liquors. We fast till the evening
              of the summer days, and two days at a time during the winter then we
              break the fast by eating only bread and salt. We keep away the boredom
              by remembering death, and how close it is. We refute every pride and
              exaltation and guard ourselves from evil thoughts by humility and piety.
              By this ascetic strive that is accomplished by the grace of God, we
              offer our souls a living sacrifice, acceptable to God, not only once but
              many times. For according to the strive and how much we exert ourselves
              in it, we realize spiritual gifts, remembering the saying of the Lord,
              "Those overcame themselves, seize the Kingdom of Heaven." When
              Pachomius heard from Abba Palamon these sayings that he never heard
              before, he was more assured by the spirit, and was encouraged on facing
              the hardships and endure the pains. He replied saying, "I am confident
              in the Lord Christ first, and by the support of your prayers second, I
              would be able to fulfill all the precepts, and persevere with you till
              death." Pachomius then kneeled before him and kissed his hand. The old
              man preached him and instructed him about the importance of mortifying
              the flesh, the humility and contrition of the heart. He told him, "If
              you kept what I told you, did not go back, or vacillate between two
              opinions, we will rejoice with you." Then he told him, "Do you think
              my son that by all what I mentioned to you from asceticism, praying,
              watching and fasting we ask for the glory of men, no my son, it is not
              like that. We lead you to the works of salvation so we would be
              blameless, for it is written every apparent thing is light, and we must
              through many tribulations enter the kingdom of heaven. Now go back to
              your abode so you might examine your self and test her for few days for
              what you are asking is not an easy task." Pachomius answered him
              saying, "I have examined myself in every thing, and I hope with the
              Grace of God and your holy prayers, that your heart would be pleased
              toward me." The old man answered, "Well." Anba Palamon accepted him
              with joy, then left him for ten days testing him in prayer, watching and
              fasting. Three month later and after he tested his patience, endurance,
              strife and will, he prayed over him, clipped off his hair, and put on
              him the garb of the monks (El-Eskeem) in year 34 A.D. They persevered
              together on asceticism and prayer as they worked in their spare times in
              weaving hair and knitting clothes to gain their bare necessities, and
              what they spared they gave to the needy. Whenever they were vigilance
              and the sleep overcame them, they went out their cells and moved sand
              from one place to another to exhaust their bodies and remove the sleep
              away from them. The old man went on preaching the young man and
              encouraging him saying, "Be courageous O Pachomius, let your devotion
              to God always be flamed with the fire of love, and be before Him, in
              fear, humility, and persevering in praying and kneeling without boredom.
              Be watchful lest the tempter examine you and grief you." It came in the
              biography of St. Pachomius in a manuscript in the monastery of
              El-Baramous the following: One day someone knocked on the door of Sts.
              Palamon and Pachomius to visit them, and he spent the night with them.
              The pride and self-reliance had overcome that person. While they were
              talking about the words of God and before them was fire, for it was
              winter, the guest told them, "Whoever of you has strong faith in God,
              let him rise up, stand on this blazing embers, and recite the prayer
              which the Lord had taught to His disciples." When the old man St.
              Palamon heard that, he admonished him saying, "Cursed is the defiled
              devil who planted this thought in your heart. so stop talking." The
              guest did not head to the words of the old man and said, "I, I would."
              He rose up and stood on the blazing coal while saying the Lord''s prayer
              slowly. Then he stepped out the fire which did not touch his body with
              any harm, and went to his abode with arrogance. Pachomius told Anba
              Palamon, "God knows that I marveled about this brother who stood on the
              amber and his feet did not burn." The old man replied saying, "Do not
              be amazed for there is no doubt that this from the work of the Devil.
              The Lord had allowed his feet not to be burned as it is written to the
              crooked, God sends crooked ways. Believe me O my son, if you know the
              torment that is prepared for him, you will be weeping for his
              wretchedness." The Devil came to this man in the form of a woman and
              enticed him to allow her to enter his cell. Because of the pride and the
              blindness of his perception, he did not realize the danger that
              surrounded him. The lust filled his heart toward her, and immediately
              the devil struck and threw him on the ground and he remained as a dead
              man for a day. When he regained his conscious and his faculties, he went
              to Abba Palamon weeping and remorseful for what he had done. He asked
              for their help and prayers for the devil had captivated him by his own
              free will. While he was talking to them, the old man and his disciple
              were weeping, the evil spirit suddenly came over him. He went to the
              mountain, and he lost his mind. He was astray for a period of time, then
              he threw himself in a fire which burned him. When the old man knew that,
              he was grieved. His disciple asked him, "How God allowed this to happen
              to him after he confessed and asked for repentance with tears and
              remorse." The Abba answered, "God with His foreknowledge knew that the
              repentance of this brother was not sincere, so He allowed him to reap
              what he did." While St. Pachomius was still staying with his teacher
              Anba Palamon, one day he was wondering in the wilderness, and he came to
              the village of Tabanseen. When he was praying, the angel of the Lord
              appeared and told him, "O Pachomius, with the order of the Lord, build
              a monastery in the spot that your are standing on, hence many will come
              to you seeking monasticism." He returned to the old man Anba Palamon
              and told him what the angel had told him, and his intention of
              fulfilling the Will of God. Anba Palamon was sad for the departure of
              his disciple and said, "How could you leave me after seven years you
              spent with me in obedience and submission and I am an old man. I see
              that it is easier on me to accompany you than you leaving me." They
              moved south until they came to Tabanseen, and started to build a
              monastery. That was in the year 311 A.D., and Pachomius was thirty years
              old. When they finished building the monastery, Anba Palamon told his
              disciple Pachomius, "My beloved son I long to return to my cell and the
              place of my solitude. I had known that God had appointed you to
              establish this monastery, which will grow and be filled with God
              pleasing monks. You shall receive power and long suffering to manage
              them. As of my self, I have became old, weak, and the time of my
              departure had drew near. So I see that my solitary life is best for me.
              Nevertheless, I ask from your kindness that you do not deprive me from
              seeing you from now and then. I shall come to visit you as the few days
              left for me allow." They were separated after they prayed with each
              other, and they visited each other. In one of the visits of Anba
              Palamon, he became ill and departed to the Lord that he served and loved
              since his young age. Anba Pachomius took the blessings of his teacher,
              shrouded and buried him. Many wonders and miracles have been attributed
              to this saint. An ancient church in his name is located in the town of
              El-Kasre and El-Sayad in a monastery named after him which had other
              churches in the name of the Virgin St. Mary, the archangel Michael, St.
              Mercurius Abu-Saifain, and St. Demianah. A great festival celebration is
              celebrated annually in his feast day. May his prayers be with us and
              Glory be to God forever. Amen. _________________________________________
              17 The biography of St. Pachomius is under the fourteenth day of Bashans
              (Vol. III, P. 430). 18 When Constantine the Great was victorious,
              Pachomius'' military detachment returned to its post in Upper Egypt, and
              the soldiers were released to return to their hometown. St. Pachomius
              arrived to his town Chinu, and met its priest and asked him to join him
              to the congregation of his church. Since Pachomius was pagan as his
              parents, the priest wrote his name among the catechumens, but God
              inspired the priest to accept him among the believers. He baptized him
              in Maundy thursday, year 31 A.D., and he was twenty years old. He grew
              in virtues, ministering to the believers, and loving the people, until
              his merits became well known. Many people gathered around him. When an
              epidemic spread in this village, he served them, and brought them wood
              from far distances. The Lord had mercy on him and saved him from the
              epidemic, and remained three years visiting the orphans, and the widows,
              ministering to their needs, keeping himself from the defilement of the
              world.'

          english: 'On this day also, of the year 316 A.M., the saint Anba Palamon the
              anchorite, departed. He was an anchorite in the Eastern Mount in a town
              called El-Kasre and El-Sayad, district of Nagaa-Hammady, governorate of
              Quena. The Devil was weary of tempting this father, and failed to
              overcome him. The Devil took every chance to direct his snares against
              him. One day, the man of God Anba Palamon rose up, took the work of his
              hand, and walked toward the countryside of Egypt. While he was walking
              in his way, he was weeping for his sins. The enemy of the good led him
              astray in the mountain, for seven days, until he was close to death from
              hunger and thirst, for it was summer. Finally, he collapsed, fell on the
              ground, wishing to die. God, the lover of mankind, wished not to leave
              His servant Anba Palamon fall prey to the devil, so He ordered the devil
              to leave him. When the old man realized that, he cried saying, "O Lord
              Jesus Christ help me." Instantly he heard a voice saying to him, "Do
              not be afraid, for the enemy can not overcome you. Rise and walk a short
              distance to the south. You shall find a righteous old monk whose name is
              Talasoun. Tell him about all that the devil has brought on you, and the
              grievous sin that he tempted you with in your young age. He will pray on
              your behalf so that your sins will be forgiven." The blessed Anba
              Palamon rose up, carried the works of his hands, and walked in the mount
              reciting Psalm fifty four, "Save me, O God, by Your name, And vindicate
              me by Your strength. Hear my prayer, O God; Give ear to the words of my
              mouth. For strangers have risen up against me, And oppressors have
              sought after my life; They have not set God before them. Behold, God is
              my helper; The Lord is with those who uphold my life. He will repay my
              enemies for their evil. Cut them off in Your truth. I will freely
              sacrifice to You; I will praise Your name, O LORD, for it is good. For
              He has delivered me out of all trouble; And my eye has seen its desire
              upon my enemies." He also recited Psalms 68, "Let God arise, Let His
              enemies be scattered; Let those also who hate Him flee before Him. As
              smoke is driven away, So drive them away; As wax melts before the fire,
              So let the wicked perish at the presence of God. But let the righteous
              be glad; Let them rejoice before God; Yes, let them rejoice
              exceedingly." He did not cease praying until God guided him to the
              place of Anba Talasoun. When Anba Talasoun saw him, he rejoiced
              exceedingly, greeted him, held his hand and pulled him up the rock where
              he lived. They prayed, then sat down talking about the greatness of God.
              Anba Talasoun asked Anba Palamon about how he found his way to come to
              visit him in this wilderness. Then Anba Palamon started crying and
              kneeled, saying, "Please forgive me O my beloved holy father." Anba
              Talasoun said, "The Lord Jesus Christ forgives to all of us all our
              transgressions." Anba Palamon replied saying, "I am ashamed to tell
              you, O my holy father, about the enormous sin that befell me by the
              Devil without knowing." Anba Talasoun told him, "It is written
              ''Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that you
              may be healed.''" When Anba Palamon saw that the blessed Anba Talasoun
              was comforting and encouraging him, he started to tell him, "While I
              was living in the monastery, I asked God to forgive me my sins. I also
              read in the holy books of the fathers which are inspired by the Spirit
              of God, that solitary life brings forth the fear of God, and God
              despises mockery and laughing for no reason. So I decided to live a
              solitary life in my small home, to not talk to anyone, and never to
              laugh, but to cry on my sins by day and night. The Devil often fought
              against me. He tried to please my heart with laughter but I did not heed
              him, and I never cursed. I fought for a long time through these
              tribulations, steadfast in the salvation of our Lord Christ until the
              enemy was wrath with me. One day I took the work of my hands, walked in
              the mount to go to sell it and buy a little of bread. After I was at a
              considerable distance from my abode, the Devil captivated me, and right
              away I lost my mind. He removed the Name of God from my mouth and I was
              no longer reciting the Divine sayings. The mount changed entirely before
              me, the sandy earth became black. When I looked before me I saw a new
              city, had splendid buildings, magnificent houses, rich palaces, and the
              city had shining armored gat which was fortified as a city of a king,
              surrounded by trees and gardens. When I saw it, I wondered about this
              city and its great distinction."When I inclined to enter the city
              thinking that its people might buy from me the work of my hands. As I
              came close to the walls of the city, I found a turning water wheel
              (sakieh), and I saw a sorrowful woman. Her face was very gloomy. Her
              clothes were torn and her veil covered her eyes for the sake of decency.
              She was standing beside the well, running the water wheel and watering
              the vines. When she saw me, she sat down, covered her head and said,
              ''Bless me O my holy father.'' In hast she put down the baskets before me
              then said, ''Sit down and rest O my beloved father for you had become
              tired from what you have carried.'' She sat me down beside running water,
              she took water in her hands, poured it on my feet, and washed them as
              someone taking blessings. She acted as a woman of a rich man. I asked
              her, ''O faithful woman, tell me, if I enter this city with the work of
              my hands would I find one who would buy it from me?'' She said, ''Yes,
              they would buy it from you. Nevertheless, leave it and I will buy it
              from you, and I will give you all that you need. For I was married to a
              rich man who died recently and left me much money and herds of cattle. I
              pick the fruits of these enormous vines, and I do not have anyone to
              oversee it. I wish to have a man like you, to whom I can hand all my
              possessions, to handle the way he sees fit. So if you accept, O my holy
              father, to come and oversee my house and to take charge of all my
              possessions, I will take you as a husband.'' I replied, ''If the monk gets
              married, shame and disgrace follow him.'' Then the woman told me, ''If you
              do not take me as a wife, be an overseer for my possessions. You
              supervise it during the day, for I own fields, cattle, barns, vineyards,
              slaves and maiden servants, and when the night falls you shall fulfill
              your prayers.'' Then she rose up, and took me to her house. She prepared
              a table of different kinds of foods and placed it before me. Afterwards,
              she went to her room, and put on expensive and extravagant clothes, then
              came and embraced me. I was surprised and I held fast to the power of
              God almighty, and crossed myself with the sign of the cross. All that I
              saw immediately vanished as the smoke before the winds, and nothing of
              what this woman did remained. "Instantly, I realized that all of this
              was the doing of the Devil who wished to make me fall in sin. I cried
              bitterly, and regretted much what I had done. The Lord had compassion on
              me with His tender mercy, and sent me His angel who comforted me, and
              promised the forgiveness of my sins and told me, ''Go to the saint Anba
              Talasoun who is nearby you, and confess to him your sins. Tell him that
              you have come to him so that the Lord may forgive your sins through his
              prayers.''" The saint Anba Talasoun prayed saying, "O my son may the
              Lord forgive you and myself." Subsequently, a table came down from
              heaven, they ate, then Anba Palamon returned to his place of worship in
              peace. This Saint received the gift of healing from God. The beasts were
              friendly to him, he fed them by his hands, and they licked his feet. He
              lived naked, so God lengthened his hair until it covered his whole body.
              He fasted the whole week, only ate on Saturday and Sunday. He ate a half
              loaf of bread that God sent him with the raven. Often he ate from the
              vegetation of the mount. He was merciful, compassionate, and tender like
              His creator. When the night fell, he went down from his place of
              worship, to visit the prisoners, orphans, widowers, those in trouble,
              and the sojourners, as his strength allowed him, to help them from the
              price of the works of his hands. St. Palamon was fervent in his
              asceticism and worship. He persevered, all the days of his life, in the
              daily and nightly prayers, and watching all night in ascetic worships.
              St. Pachomius17, the father of the monastic cenobite, was the disciple
              of this saint. When St. Pachomius18 rejected paganism and adopted
              Christianity, he wished to live a life of asceticism and worship, so the
              priest of his hometown directed him to go to the great hermit Anba
              Palamon. Pachomius handed the care for the poor and the needy in his
              town to another elder monk, and went to Anba Palamon. When he arrived,
              he knocked the door of his cell. The old man looked from an aperture and
              asked him, "Who are you O brother? and what do you want?" Pachomius
              answered hastily, "I, O blessed father, looking for the Christ the God
              Whom you do worship, and I beg your fatherhood to accept me and to make
              me a monk." Abba Palamon told him, "O my son, monasticism is not an
              unrestricted labor, and the man does not come into it as he pleases, for
              many had adopted it not knowing its hardships, and when they adopted it
              they could not endure it, and you have heard about it without knowing
              its contention." Pachomius replied, "Do not turn my request, and my
              desire, and do not put off the flame of my zeal. Accept me, be patient
              with me, and examine me, and afterward do whatever you see fit with
              me." The old man told him, "Go, O my son test your self alone for a
              period of time, then come back to me for I am willing to labor with you
              as much as my weakness allows so you might know your own self. The
              monastic piety needs toughness and asceticism, and I will teach you
              first its extent. Then you go and examine your self if you could endure
              the matter or not. My intent in that, God knows, is for the sake of your
              teaching and discipline and not for any other reason. When we, O my
              beloved son, knew the vanity and trickery of this world, we came to this
              distant place, and carried on our shoulders the cross of our Christ, not
              the wooden rod, but the overcoming of the flesh, subduing its lusts, and
              wasting its power. We spent the night praying and glorifying God. Often
              we vigil from sun set till the morning praying and working much with our
              hands, making either ropes, braid palm fibers, weave palm leaves or hair
              to resist sleep and to have what our bodies need and to feed the poor as
              the apostle said, ''remember the needy.'' We entirely do not know the
              eating of oil, cooked food or drinking liquors. We fast till the evening
              of the summer days, and two days at a time during the winter then we
              break the fast by eating only bread and salt. We keep away the boredom
              by remembering death, and how close it is. We refute every pride and
              exaltation and guard ourselves from evil thoughts by humility and piety.
              By this ascetic strive that is accomplished by the grace of God, we
              offer our souls a living sacrifice, acceptable to God, not only once but
              many times. For according to the strive and how much we exert ourselves
              in it, we realize spiritual gifts, remembering the saying of the Lord,
              "Those overcame themselves, seize the Kingdom of Heaven." When
              Pachomius heard from Abba Palamon these sayings that he never heard
              before, he was more assured by the spirit, and was encouraged on facing
              the hardships and endure the pains. He replied saying, "I am confident
              in the Lord Christ first, and by the support of your prayers second, I
              would be able to fulfill all the precepts, and persevere with you till
              death." Pachomius then kneeled before him and kissed his hand. The old
              man preached him and instructed him about the importance of mortifying
              the flesh, the humility and contrition of the heart. He told him, "If
              you kept what I told you, did not go back, or vacillate between two
              opinions, we will rejoice with you." Then he told him, "Do you think
              my son that by all what I mentioned to you from asceticism, praying,
              watching and fasting we ask for the glory of men, no my son, it is not
              like that. We lead you to the works of salvation so we would be
              blameless, for it is written every apparent thing is light, and we must
              through many tribulations enter the kingdom of heaven. Now go back to
              your abode so you might examine your self and test her for few days for
              what you are asking is not an easy task." Pachomius answered him
              saying, "I have examined myself in every thing, and I hope with the
              Grace of God and your holy prayers, that your heart would be pleased
              toward me." The old man answered, "Well." Anba Palamon accepted him
              with joy, then left him for ten days testing him in prayer, watching and
              fasting. Three month later and after he tested his patience, endurance,
              strife and will, he prayed over him, clipped off his hair, and put on
              him the garb of the monks (El-Eskeem) in year 34 A.D. They persevered
              together on asceticism and prayer as they worked in their spare times in
              weaving hair and knitting clothes to gain their bare necessities, and
              what they spared they gave to the needy. Whenever they were vigilance
              and the sleep overcame them, they went out their cells and moved sand
              from one place to another to exhaust their bodies and remove the sleep
              away from them. The old man went on preaching the young man and
              encouraging him saying, "Be courageous O Pachomius, let your devotion
              to God always be flamed with the fire of love, and be before Him, in
              fear, humility, and persevering in praying and kneeling without boredom.
              Be watchful lest the tempter examine you and grief you." It came in the
              biography of St. Pachomius in a manuscript in the monastery of
              El-Baramous the following: One day someone knocked on the door of Sts.
              Palamon and Pachomius to visit them, and he spent the night with them.
              The pride and self-reliance had overcome that person. While they were
              talking about the words of God and before them was fire, for it was
              winter, the guest told them, "Whoever of you has strong faith in God,
              let him rise up, stand on this blazing embers, and recite the prayer
              which the Lord had taught to His disciples." When the old man St.
              Palamon heard that, he admonished him saying, "Cursed is the defiled
              devil who planted this thought in your heart. so stop talking." The
              guest did not head to the words of the old man and said, "I, I would."
              He rose up and stood on the blazing coal while saying the Lord''s prayer
              slowly. Then he stepped out the fire which did not touch his body with
              any harm, and went to his abode with arrogance. Pachomius told Anba
              Palamon, "God knows that I marveled about this brother who stood on the
              amber and his feet did not burn." The old man replied saying, "Do not
              be amazed for there is no doubt that this from the work of the Devil.
              The Lord had allowed his feet not to be burned as it is written to the
              crooked, God sends crooked ways. Believe me O my son, if you know the
              torment that is prepared for him, you will be weeping for his
              wretchedness." The Devil came to this man in the form of a woman and
              enticed him to allow her to enter his cell. Because of the pride and the
              blindness of his perception, he did not realize the danger that
              surrounded him. The lust filled his heart toward her, and immediately
              the devil struck and threw him on the ground and he remained as a dead
              man for a day. When he regained his conscious and his faculties, he went
              to Abba Palamon weeping and remorseful for what he had done. He asked
              for their help and prayers for the devil had captivated him by his own
              free will. While he was talking to them, the old man and his disciple
              were weeping, the evil spirit suddenly came over him. He went to the
              mountain, and he lost his mind. He was astray for a period of time, then
              he threw himself in a fire which burned him. When the old man knew that,
              he was grieved. His disciple asked him, "How God allowed this to happen
              to him after he confessed and asked for repentance with tears and
              remorse." The Abba answered, "God with His foreknowledge knew that the
              repentance of this brother was not sincere, so He allowed him to reap
              what he did." While St. Pachomius was still staying with his teacher
              Anba Palamon, one day he was wondering in the wilderness, and he came to
              the village of Tabanseen. When he was praying, the angel of the Lord
              appeared and told him, "O Pachomius, with the order of the Lord, build
              a monastery in the spot that your are standing on, hence many will come
              to you seeking monasticism." He returned to the old man Anba Palamon
              and told him what the angel had told him, and his intention of
              fulfilling the Will of God. Anba Palamon was sad for the departure of
              his disciple and said, "How could you leave me after seven years you
              spent with me in obedience and submission and I am an old man. I see
              that it is easier on me to accompany you than you leaving me." They
              moved south until they came to Tabanseen, and started to build a
              monastery. That was in the year 311 A.D., and Pachomius was thirty years
              old. When they finished building the monastery, Anba Palamon told his
              disciple Pachomius, "My beloved son I long to return to my cell and the
              place of my solitude. I had known that God had appointed you to
              establish this monastery, which will grow and be filled with God
              pleasing monks. You shall receive power and long suffering to manage
              them. As of my self, I have became old, weak, and the time of my
              departure had drew near. So I see that my solitary life is best for me.
              Nevertheless, I ask from your kindness that you do not deprive me from
              seeing you from now and then. I shall come to visit you as the few days
              left for me allow." They were separated after they prayed with each
              other, and they visited each other. In one of the visits of Anba
              Palamon, he became ill and departed to the Lord that he served and loved
              since his young age. Anba Pachomius took the blessings of his teacher,
              shrouded and buried him. Many wonders and miracles have been attributed
              to this saint. An ancient church in his name is located in the town of
              El-Kasre and El-Sayad in a monastery named after him which had other
              churches in the name of the Virgin St. Mary, the archangel Michael, St.
              Mercurius Abu-Saifain, and St. Demianah. A great festival celebration is
              celebrated annually in his feast day. May his prayers be with us and
              Glory be to God forever. Amen. _________________________________________
              17 The biography of St. Pachomius is under the fourteenth day of Bashans
              (Vol. III, P. 430). 18 When Constantine the Great was victorious,
              Pachomius'' military detachment returned to its post in Upper Egypt, and
              the soldiers were released to return to their hometown. St. Pachomius
              arrived to his town Chinu, and met its priest and asked him to join him
              to the congregation of his church. Since Pachomius was pagan as his
              parents, the priest wrote his name among the catechumens, but God
              inspired the priest to accept him among the believers. He baptized him
              in Maundy thursday, year 31 A.D., and he was twenty years old. He grew
              in virtues, ministering to the believers, and loving the people, until
              his merits became well known. Many people gathered around him. When an
              epidemic spread in this village, he served them, and brought them wood
              from far distances. The Lord had mercy on him and saved him from the
              epidemic, and remained three years visiting the orphans, and the widows,
              ministering to their needs, keeping himself from the defilement of the
              world.'
