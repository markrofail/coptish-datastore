      arabic: 1. استشهاد القديس يوحنا وسمعان ابن عمه

      english: On this day, Sts. John and Simon, his cousin, who were from the city of
        Shoubramalas (Ziftah-Gharbiah), were martyred. The mother of St. John
        was barren, and his father prayed ceaselessly to the Lord to give him a
        son, whom he would vow to the Lord. He saw in a vision St. John the
        Baptist, who told him that the Lord would give him a son. When this
        Saint was born, his father called him John, and he built a church in the
        name of St. John the Baptist. When the boy grew and was twelve years
        old, his father put him in charge of tending the sheep. John gave his
        food to the shepherds, and he fasted until the evening daily. When his
        father heard this, he went to him to verify that. When the boy saw him,
        he was afraid that his father might beat him, and he wanted to flee. His
        father calmed him and asked him about his food. John replied, "It is
        inside the hut." When the father went inside, he found the basket full
        of hot bread. He returned and told his mother what had happened and both
        rejoiced for the grace that was bestowed upon their son. They prevented
        their son from tending the sheep, and handed him to one who taught him
        the church books. When John became eighteen years old, they ordained him
        a priest. Simon, his cousin, who was also tending to the sheep of his
        father, left that and became a disciple of this Saint. God wrought many
        signs by the hands of St. John. When Diocletian denied Christ and
        worshipped idols, Sts. John and Simon went to Alexandria. They confessed
        the Lord Christ before its Governor, who tortured them much. Finally, he
        cut off their heads, and they received the crown of martyrdom. May their
        prayers be with us. Amen.
      arabic: "في مثل هذا اليوم استشهد القديسان يوحنا وسمعان ابن عمه اللذين من شبراملس
        (مركز زفتي غربية ) . وقد كانت والدة يوحنا عاقرا فداوم والده علي الصلاة
        إلى الرب أن يعطيه ولدا يقدمه نذرا له فرأي في رؤيا كأن القديس يوحنا
        المعمدان يعلمه أن الرب سيعطيه ولدا . فلما رزق بهذا القديس سماه يوحنا
        وبني كنيسة علي اسم القديس يوحنا المعمدان فلما نشأ الصبي وصار عمره إحدى
        عشر سنة كلفه والده رعاية غنمه فكان يوزع غذاءه علي الرعاة ويبقي هو صائما
        طول يومه . ولما علم والده ذهب اليه ليتحقق هذا الأمر فلما رآه الصبي خاف
        أن يضربه وهم بالهروب . فطمأنه والده ثم سأله عن غذائه فأجابه:انه في
        العشة فلما دخل والده وجد المقطف ملآنا خبزا فعاد وأعلم والدته بذلك وفرح
        الوالدان بالنعمة التي شملت ولدهما ومنعاه من رعاية الغنم وسلماه لمن علمه
        كتب الكنيسة . ولما بلغ من العمر ثماني عشرة سنة رسموه قسا . أما سمعان ابن
        عمه فكان أيضا يرعي غنم أبيه فترك ذلك وتتلمذ لهذا القديس وقد أجري الله
        علي يدي القديس يوحنا آيات كثيرة . ولما أثار دقلديانوس عبادة الأوثان ذهب
        القديسان يوحنا وسمعان إلى الإسكندرية واعترفا أمام الوالي بالسيد المسيح
        فعذبهما كثيرا وأخيرا قطع رأسيهما ونالا إكليل الشهادة صلاتهما تكون معنا .
        آمين"
