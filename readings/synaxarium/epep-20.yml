      english: On this day, of the year 220 A.D., St. Theodore of Shotep was martyred.
        His father's name was John and he was from the city of Shotep in Upper
        Egypt. He went with his regiment to the city of Antioch, where he
        married the daughter of a pagan noble man, and begot by her this St.
        Theodore. When his mother wanted to present him to the house of idols to
        be educated there, his father refused. She became angry, drove him away,
        and the child remained with his mother. His father John prayed
        ceaselessly, and entreated God to guide his son Theodore to the path of
        salvation. The child grew up, and learned philosophy, wisdom, and
        literature. The Lord Christ illuminated his heart, and Theodore went to
        a righteous bishop who baptized him. When his mother heard of this she
        was sorrowed greatly, but the Saint did not mind her. He joined the army
        and advanced in the ranks until he became one of the great generals
        during the reign of Emperor Lucianus. The people of the city of Eukhitos
        worshipped a great serpent, and offered to him a human sacrifice every
        year. While St. Theodore was passing through this district, he saw a
        woman crying bitterly. He asked her about the reason for her crying. She
        answered him saying, "I am a widow and they have taken my two sons to
        offer them as a sacrifice to the serpent, although I am Christian." He
        said to himself, "They have wronged this woman, but God shall avenge
        her." He came down from his horse, and turned his face towards the East
        and prayed, then drew near the serpent. The people of the city were
        watching him from the tops of the walls of the city. The serpent was
        fourteen cubits long, but God gave him power over it, and he speared it
        with his spear and killed it, and delivered the sons of the widow. After
        this, Theodore came to Egypt to search for his father, and he stayed
        with him until he died, and then returned to Antioch. He found that the
        Emperor had apostatized the faith and started to persecute the
        Christians. He came before him and confessed the Lord Christ. The
        Emperor ordered him beaten with rods, burned, and cast into the fire. He
        delivered up his soul and received the crown of martyrdom. A Christian
        woman took his body - it was said that she was his mother - after she
        gave much money to the soldiers and hid his body until the end of the
        time of persecution. Churches were built in his name in many cities. May
        his prayers be with us and Glory be to God forever. Amen.
      arabic: "في مثل هذا اليوم من سنة 220 م استشهد القديس ثاؤدورس الشطبي كان أبوه
        يسمي يوحنا من شطب بصعيد مصر قد ذهب ضمن الجنود إلى إنطاكية وهناك تزوج من
        أبنه أحد الأمراء الوثنيين ورزق منها بثاؤدورس هذا ولما أرادت أن تقدم
        ابنها لبيوت الأصنام ليتعلم هناك مانع والده في ذلك . فغضبت منه وطردته .
        وظل الصبي عند أمه . أما والده فكان مداوما الصلاة ليهديه إلى طريق الخلاص
        . وكبر الصبي وتعلم الحكمة والأدب فأضاء السيد المسيح قلبه ومضي إلى أسقف
        قديس وتعمد منه وسمعت بذلك أمه فشق عليها كثيرا . ولكن القديس لم يأبه لها
        وتدرج في مراتب الجندية ، حتى صار من كبار القواد في عهد ليكينيوس قيصر .
        وكان أهل أوخيطوس يعبدون ثعبانا هائلا ويقدمون له ضحية بشرية كل عام .
        واتفق مرور ثاؤدورس في تلك الجهة فرأي أرملة تبكي بكاء مرا فسألها عن سبب
        بكائها فقالت له:انني أرملة وقد أخذوا ولدي ليقدموهما ضحية للثعبان مع
        أنني مسيحية فقال ثاؤدورس في نفسه:أنها أرملة ومظلومة والرب ينتقم لها .
        ثم نزل عن حصانه وحول وجهه نحو الشرق وصلي ، ثم تقدم إلى الثعبان وأهل
        المدينة ينظرون إليه من فوق الأسوار وطعنه بالرمح فقتله وخلص ولدي الأرملة
        . وكان طول هذا التنين اثني عشر ذراعا . وحضر ثاؤدورس بعد ذلك إلى مصر ولبث
        عند أبيه حتى توفي فعاد إلى إنطاكية فوجد أن الملك قد كفر وأخذ يضطهد
        المسيحيين . فتقدم إليه واعترف بالمسيح ز فأمر بحرقه وطرحه في النار .
        وهكذا أسلم الروح ونال إكليل الشهادة وأخذت جسده امرأة مؤمنة - قيل أنها
        أمه - بعد أن بذلت أموالا كثيرة وأخفته عندها حتى انتهي زمن الاضطهاد وقد
        بنيت علي اسمه كنائس في جهات متفرقة . صلاته تكون معنا . ولربنا المجد
        دائما . آمين"
