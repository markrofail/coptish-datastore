      english: On this day, St. James the Apostle, Bishop of Jerusalem, who was the
        son of Alphaeus, was martyred. (Mat. 10:3) The Holy Bible mentioned his
        brothers, Joses, Simon, and Judas, the sons of Cleophas. (Mat. 13:55)
        The Greek word "Cleophas" means in the Syriac language "Alphaeus". His
        mother, the sister of the Virgin, was also called Mary and was the wife
        of Cleophas. (John 19:25) When he grew up he was known as James the
        Just. For there was a drought in Palestine and he prayed to God, Who
        sent the rain and watered the land, as Josephus, the Jewish historian,
        testified. He was called James the Less, to identify him from St. James
        the son of Zebedee, and the brother of St. John the beloved. It was said
        that the Lord had appointed him bishop of Jerusalem when he appeared to
        him. "After that He was seen by James, then by all the apostles." (I
        Cor. 15:7) He was called the head of the church in Jerusalem for it was
        the mother church and from it the Good News had spread to the other
        churches. He wrote a liturgy, with which the Armenians still pray.
        During his time and in the year 53 A.D. a Council of the Apostles and
        priests convened in Jerusalem and St. James presided over it. During
        this Council St. James said, "Therefore I judge that we should not
        trouble those from among the Gentiles who are turning to God, "but that
        we write to them to abstain from things polluted by idols, from sexual
        immorality, from things strangled, and from blood ... " (Acts 15:19-21)
        St. James preached and taught the Name of the Lord Christ, brought many
        back to the faith, and baptized them. God wrought by his hands many
        signs and wonders. One day, many of the Jews came to him and asked him
        to tell them about the Lord Christ. They thought that he would tell them
        that Jesus was his brother. St. James went up to the pulpit, and began
        to explain to them the Godhead of the Lord Christ, His eternal
        existence, and His equality with God the Father. When they heard this
        they were wrath with him, they dragged him down, and beat him severely.
        One of them beat the apostle on the head with an iron rod, and he
        delivered up his soul instantly. It was said about this Saint, that he
        never drank wine, and never wore clothes, but always wore a linen
        loin-cloth, and that he kneeled so often during his worship and praying
        that his feet and knees became swollen, and the skin of his knees became
        like that of the camels. May his prayers be with us and Glory be to God
        forever. Amen.
      arabic: في مثل هذا اليوم استشهد القديس يعقوب الرسول ابن حلفا . وذلك انه بعدما
        نادي بالبشري في بلاد كثيرة عاد إلى أورشليم ، ودخل هيكل اليهود ، وكرز
        بالإنجيل جهارا ، وبالإيمان بالسيد المسيح وقيامة الأموات . فاختطفه اليهود
        وأتوا به إلى اكلوديوس نائب ملك رومية وقالوا له إن هذا يبشر بملك أخر غير
        قيصر ، فأمر إن يرجم بالحجارة فرجموه حتى تنيح بسلام فاخذ قوم من المؤمنين
        جسده ودفنوه بجانب الهيكل. صلاته تكون معنا آمين.
