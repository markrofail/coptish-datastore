      english: On this day, St. Zacharias the monk, departed. His father's name was
        Karyos. He was married, but he longed for the monastic life. He told his
        wife about what was on his mind and she agreed to it. Karyos had a son,
        called Zacharias and a daughter. He left them with their mother and went
        to the desert of Scete and became a monk at the hands of a holy old man.
        Shortly after, there was a great famine in the country and the wife took
        the two children and came to the desert where their father Karyos was.
        She complained to him about the tribulation which had come upon her
        through the famine and handed him the children. But Karyos told her,
        "God has divided the two children between us. You take the girl and
        leave the boy with me." She took her daughter and departed. Karyos took
        his son Zacharias and brought him to the elders who prayed over him and
        they prophesied that he would become a perfect monk. Zacharias was
        brought up well in the desert, and advanced in every virtue. Because he
        was exceedingly handsome and his fair look, there were many murmurs in
        the desert because of him and they said, "How is it, a boy like that
        dwells in the desert among the monks?" When St. Zacharias heard that, he
        went to lake El-Natroun (which was very salty) without telling anyone.
        He took off his apparel, plunged his body into the lake, and remained in
        it for many hours. The color of his body became black and he looked like
        a leper. Then he went forth from the water, put on his apparel and came
        to his father who did not recognize him until he had stared at him
        closely. When he asked him about what had changed his appearance, he
        told him what he had done. When it was Sunday, he went with his father
        to the church to partake of the Holy Mysteries. The Lord revealed to St.
        Isidore, the priest of Scete, what St. Zacharias had done. He marvelled
        and said to the monks, "Zacharias received the offering last Sunday as a
        man, but now he has become an angel." This saint possessed many virtues,
        especially the virtue of humility in which he had reached such a degree
        of perfection that his father said about him, "I have labored greatly in
        the fight, but I have never attained the extent of my son Zacharias."
        St. Zacharias lived a strenuous life and strove exceedingly hard for 45
        years. When he came to the desert, he was seven years old and all the
        days of his life numbered 52 years, then he departed in peace. His
        prayers be with us and Glory be to our God, forever. Amen
