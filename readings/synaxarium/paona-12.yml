      arabic: 1. عيد رئيس الملائكة الجليل ميخائيل
    text:
      english: On this day, the church celebrates the commemoration of the honorable
        Archangel Michael, intercessor of the human race. The one who appeared
        to Joshua the son of Nun, encouraged him, and told him, "Nay, but as
        captain of the hosts of the Lord am I now come." He made the city of
        Jericho to fall into his hands, and he stopped the sun for him. May his
        intercession be with us. Amen.
      arabic: فى مثل هذا اليوم تحتفل الكنيسة بتذكار رئيس جند السماء الملاك الجليل
        ميخائيل الشفيع في جنس البشر الذي ظهر ليشوع بن نون وقال له " أنا رئيس جند
        الله " . وعضده وحطم العمالقة وأسقط مدينة أريحا في يده وأوقف له الشمس.
        شفاعته تكون معنا . أمين كان الوثنيون بالإسكندرية يعبدون الصنم زحل صاحب
        التمثال الذي بنته كليوباترا في اليوم الثاني عشر من شهر بؤونه ، وفي أيام
        الملك قسطنطين أخذ البابا الكسندروس في وعظ الجميع مظهرا لهم خطأ عبادة
        الأوثان التي لا تعقل ولا تتحرك وخطأ تقديم الذبائح لها . ثم حول هيكل هذا
        الصنم إلى كنيسة باسم الملاك ميخائيل بعد أن حطم التمثال وطلب منهم أن
        يذبحوا الذبائح لله الحي ويوزعوها علي الفقراء الذين دعاهم أخوته حتى
        يكسبوا بذلك شفاعة الملاك ميخائيل . وكانت هذه الكنيسة تسمي وقتئذ بكنيسة
        القيسارية (عن مخطوط بشبين الكوم) . وقد قيل ان هذا العيد أيضا أخذ عن
        المصريين القدماء الذين كانوا يعتقدون أن زيادة النيل تبتدئ في الليلة
        الثانية عشرة من شهر بؤونة ( نزول النقطة ) أي دمعة إيزيس آلهة الخصب
        والنماء وهي الدمعة التي أراقتها حزنا علي زوجها " اوزيريس اله الخير الذي
        قتله " تيفون " اله الشر وقد استبدل هذا العيد في المسيحية بعيد رئيس
        الملائكة ميخائيل (تاريخ الأمة القبطية )شفاعته تكون معنا . ولربنا المجد
        دائما . آمين

    text:
      english: On this day also, of the year 135 A.D., St. Justus, the Sixth Pope of
        the See of St. Mark, departed. This saint was an honorable and learned
        man before his ordination. He was baptized by St. Mark the Apostle,
        along with his father, his mother and others. St. Anianus, the second
        pope, ordained him a deacon, then a priest, and appointed him to preach,
        and teach the people. He was chosen for the papacy to succeed Pope
        Primus. He shepherded his people with the best of care for ten years. He
        departed at a pleasing good old age. May his prayers be with us. Amen.
      arabic: فى مثل هذا اليوم تنيحت القديسة أوفيمية وكانت زوجة لرجل يتقي الله ويعمل
        صدقات كثيرة. وكان يهتم بثلاثة أعياد كل شهر وهي تذكار الملاك ميخائيل في
        الثاني عشر ، وتذكار والدة الإله في الحادي والعشرين ، وتذكار الميلاد
        المجيد في التاسع والعشرين . ولما دنت ساعة وفاته أوصي زوجته بحفظ هذه
        العادة وأن لا تقطع عمل الصدقات خصوصا في الأعياد الثلاثة فأحضرت صورة
        الملاك ميخائيل ، وبعد وفاة زوجها ثابرت علي تنفيذ وصيته ، فحسدها الشيطان
        وأتاها في شكل راهب ، وجعل يحدثها ويؤكد لها أنه مشفق عليها ثم أشار عليها
        أن تتزوج لترزق أولادا وان تكف عن عمل الصدقات لئلا ينفذ مالها وقال لها ان
        زوجك قد نال الملكوت فلا يحتاج إلى صدقة فأجابته قائلة أنني قطعت مع نفسي
        عهدا بأن لا التصق برجل بعد زوجي وزادت بقولها إذا كانت الطيور كاليمام
        والغربان لا تعرف ذكرا آخر بعد الأول . فأولي بالبشر الذين خلقوا في صورة
        الله ومثاله أن يكونوا هكذا ، فتركها الشيطان غاضبا . ولما أتي يوم عيد
        الملاك وقد جهزت كل ما يلزم كعادتها ظهر لها الشيطان في زي ملاك وأعطاها
        السلام قائلا ان الملاك ميخائيل أرسله إليها يأمرها أن تترك الصدقات وتتزوج
        برجل مؤمن ثم قال لها ان امرأة بدون رجل كسفينة بغير رئيس وصار يورد لها من
        الكتاب المقدس أدلة عن إبراهيم واسحق ويعقوب وداود وغيرهم ممن تزوجوا
        وأرضوا الله فأجابته قائلة ان كنت ملاك الله فأين الصليب علامة جنديتك لان
        جندي الملك لا يخرج إلى مكان إلا ومعه هذه العلامة . فلما سمع منها هذا
        الكلام عاد إلى شكله الأول ووثب عليها يريد خنقها . فاستغاثت بالملاك
        ميخائيل صاحب العيد فخلصها في الحال ثم قال لها هيا رتبي أمورك لأنك في هذا
        اليوم تنتقلين من هذا العالم وقد اعد لك الرب ما لم تره عين ولا سمعت به
        أذن ولم يخطر علي قلب بشر وأعطاها السلام وصعد إلى السماء . أما القديسة
        فأنها بعد انتهاء العيد استدعت إليها الأب الأسقف والكهنة وسلمت لهم
        أموالها لتوزيعها علي المحتاجين ثم تنيحت بسلام . صلاتها تكون معنا آمين

      english: 3. The Departure of St. Kyrillos the Second, the 67th Pope of Alexandria.

    text:
      english: On this day also, the twelfth of Baounah, 88 A.M. (June 6th, 192 A.D.),
        the great Pope, St. Kyrillos the Second, the 67th Pope of Alexandria,
        departed. He became a monk in Sawma'et (Cell) of Singar. Because of his
        knowledge and righteousness, they chose him a Patriarch, a successor to
        St. Christodolus, the 66th Pope. His enthronement was on 22nd of
        Baramhat, 794 A.M. (March 18th, 178 A.D.). Some of the bishops disobeyed
        the Pope and decided to depose him. They assembled a council from
        forty-seven bishops for this purpose. When the Fatimid governor knew of
        this dissension, he called the bishops to his orchard. He harshly talked
        to them with words God had put in his mouth. The overseer of the orchard
        (Yaseeb) sided with those who opposed the Pope. Peter, the pope's
        disciple, reproved him and an exchange of words took place between them
        while the Pope was coming out of the meeting. The Pope told the
        overseer, "If the Governor has authority, Christ has authority over the
        heaven and earth." The Pope dismounted his horse, and made a matonia
        before him, which was on Saturday the 23rd of Misra, 82 A.M. On the next
        Saturday, the governor became enraged with the overseer of his orchard.
        He went there and ordered the beheading of the overseer. That was in the
        same place where the Pope had made the matonia to him and in the same
        hour. The Governor told the dissenting bishops, "You all should be in
        accordance, and obey your Archbishop." Thus, they all were reconciled,
        and went to the church of St. Marcurius. They celebrated the Divine
        liturgy on Saturday and Sunday and then went to their parishes
        rejoicing. This Pope remained on the Chair for fourteen years, two
        month, and thirteen days, then departed in peace. May his prayers be
        with us. Amen.

      english: 4. The Departure of St. Euphemia.
      arabic: ""
    text:
      english: 'This day also, marks the martyrdom of St. Euphemia. She was the wife
        of a man who feared God, and gave much alms. He kept three festivals
        each month: the commemoration of the angel Michael, on the twelfth
        day(1); the commemoration of the Mother of God (Theotokos), on the
        twenty-first day; and the commemoration of the Nativity of our Lord, on
        the twenty-ninth day of each month. When the day of his departure drew
        near, he commanded his wife, to keep this custom, to not stop the giving
        of alms, and to do the acts of charity especially on these three
        festivals. He painted a picture of the honorable angel Michael and gave
        it to her. After the departure of her husband, she continued to fulfill
        his will. Satan was jealous of her, and he came to her disguised as a
        monk, who talked to her expressing his pity for her. He advised her to
        get married, to bring forth children, and to refrain from doing
        charitable deeds lest she finish her money. He told her also that her
        husband had received the Kingdom and he had no need of the alms giving.
        She answered saying, "I have vowed not to consort with another man after
        my husband." She went on saying, "If birds as the doves and the ravens
        do not take second mates, how then can men who are created in the form
        and likeness of God do this?" The devil left her angry. When the feast
        of the Angel had come, and she had prepared all what she needed as her
        custom, Satan appeared to her in the form of an angel and said to her,
        "Peace be to you, the angel Michael has sent me to you, commanding you
        to cease from these alms, and to marry a believing man." Then he told
        her, "A woman without a man is like a ship without a captain," and he
        began to bring her proofs out of the Holy Bible in regard of Abraham,
        Isaac, Jacob, David, and others like them who married wives and pleased
        God. She replied saying, "If you are an angel of God, where is the
        Cross, the symbol of your military service? For the soldier of the King
        never goes to any place without this symbol with him." When Satan heard
        these words from her, he returned to his original form, and jumped on
        her to choke her. She cried for the angel Michael, whose feast she was
        celebrating, and he delivered her immediately from him. The angel
        Michael told her, "Go and arrange your affairs, for you shall depart
        from this world today. And behold the Lord has prepared for you what eye
        has not seen, and ear has not heard, nor has it occurred to the heart of
        man," then he gave her the greeting of peace, and went up into heaven.
        After, St. Euphemia had celebrated the feast of the angel Michael, she
        sent for the father the bishop and the priests. She gave them all her
        money to give to the poor and the needy. Then, she took the Picture of
        the honorable angel Michael and prayed before it. She laid it upon her
        face and breast, then departed in peace. May his intercession be with us
        and Glory be to God forever. Amen.(1) The pagans in Alexandria
        worshipped the idol Zuhal, who had a statue and a temple, that was built
        by Cleopatra on the twelfth day of the month of Baounah. During the
        reign of Emperor Constantine, Pope Alexandros preached to the people,
        explaining to them the error of worshipping the idols that do not move
        or reason, which are made by human hands, and the error of offering
        sacrifices to them. He changed the temple of this idol to a church in
        the name of Michael the Archangel, and destroyed that statue. He asked
        them to distribute these sacrifices to the poor that Christ had called
        His brothers, to receive the intercession of the angel Michael. This
        church was called, at that time, the church of El-Kaisariah. It was said
        also that this feast was taken after the Ancient Egyptians. They
        believed that the flood of the Nile started on the eve of the twelfth of
        the month of Baounah by "the coming down of the drop." That is to say,
        the tear of "Isis," the goddess of fertility and motherhood. The tear
        that she shed grieving for her husband "Osiris," the god of agriculture
        and abundance, who was killed by "Typhon" the god of evil. This feast
        was replaced in Christianity by the feast of Michael the Archangel
        (Tareekh El-Omah El-koptiah).'
