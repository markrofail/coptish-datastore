      english: 'On this day, St. Simeon the Armenian, Bishop of the country of Persia,
        and 150 with him, were martyred. This Bishop lived during the reign of
        Sapor (Shapur), the son of Hormiz, king of Persia, who was unjust and
        oppressive to the Christians. This Saint wrote a letter to king Sapor
        and told him: "Those whom the Lord Christ has bought with His honorable
        Blood had rid themselves from the servitude of men, and it is not
        conceivable for them to be in servitude for those who transgress the
        Law." When the king had read this letter, he became exceedingly wrath.
        He brought him, bound him with chains, and cast him into the prison. In
        prison, he found prisoners who worshipped the sun. The Saint rebuked
        them, taught them, and they believed in the Lord Christ. They confessed
        their faith before the king, who brought the Saint from the prison,
        because he preached them the faith. The king ordered to cut off the
        heads of the Saint and the 150 persons with him, and they received the
        crown of martyrdom. Their prayers be with us. Amen.'
      arabic: في مثل هذا اليوم استشهد القديس سمعان الأرمني أسقف بلاد فارس ومائة وخمسون
        معه . كان هذا القديس في زمان سابور بن هرمز ملك الفرس . الذي كان كثير
        الجور والظلم علي المسيحيين ويعاملهم بقسوة . فكتب اليه هذا القديس رسالة
        قال له ان الذين ابتاعهم السيد المسيح بدمه قد تخلصوا من عبودية البشر ولا
        يجوز أن يصيروا عبيدا للذين يتعدون الشريعة . فلما قرأ الملك هذه الرسالة
        غضب جدا واستحضره ثم قيده بالسلاسل وألقاه في السجن فوجد هناك بعض
        المحبوسين يعبدون الشمس فعلمهم ووعظهم فأمنوا بالسيد المسيح وأقروا بذلك
        أمام الوالي فقطع رؤوسهم ثم استحضر القديس من السجن ومعه مائة وخمسين شخصا
        . وقطع رؤوسهم جميعا ونالوا إكليل الشهادة.

      english: 'On this day also, of the year 719 A.M., the blessed Youhanna (John)
        Abu Nagaah El-Kabeer, was martyred. He was one of the nobel Copts in the
        tenth and eleventh centuries. He was the head scribe in his time, as he
        was the lay leader during the reign of Al-Hakim Be-Amr Ellah the Fatimid
        Caliph. This great elder was a contemporary to Pope Philotheos, 63rd
        Patriarch, who was enthroned on March 28th. 979 A.D. and departed on
        November 8th. 103 A.D. Youhanna was a devout Christian, righteous,
        virtuous, charitable, and loving to the church. He was zealous in the
        Orthodox faith. When Al-Hakim Be-Amr Ellah completed the extermination
        of the people close to him and the leaders of the army, he turned to the
        notables and chiefs of the scribes. He called ten of them and offered
        them to adopt Islam. Youhanna, who was their head, was called first.
        Al-Hakim told him: "I want you to leave your faith and adopt my faith,
        the Islam. I will make you my minister to manage the affairs of my
        kingdom." Youhanna replied saying: "Give me a chance until tomorrow to
        deliberate the matter with myself" Youhanna went to his house, called
        his friends, informed them with what had happened, and told them: "I am
        ready to die in the Name of the Lord Christ, and my reason for asking
        for the delay, not to deliberate the matter with myself but to see you
        and my family, to bid you and my family farewell, and to commend you and
        them. Now my brothers, do not ask for this vain glory, for you will
        loose the eternal glory of the Lord Christ Who satisfied us with the
        richness of the world, and now with His mercy, He had called us to the
        Kingdom of Heaven, so strengthen your hearts." His golden words, which
        were full of wisdom, influenced those who heard them, strengthened their
        hearts, and they decided to die in the Name of the Lord Christ also. He
        made a great feast for them, and then they went to their homes. The next
        morning, Youhanna went to Al-Hakim Be-Amr Ellah who asked him: "O
        Nagaah, have you decided?" Youhanna (John) replied saying "Yes". The
        Caliph asked: "Which way have you decided?" Youhanna answered
        steadfastly and with courage: "Remaining in my faith." The Governor
        attempted with all ways of persuasion and threatening to make him
        forsake Christianity. John was steadfast as a rock; nothing shook him
        away from the Christian faith, and the Governor could not with all his
        powers make him renounce the faith of his fathers. When the Governor
        failed with Youhanna, he ordered to remove his clothes, be tied to the
        squeezing wheels, and be beaten. They beat him five hundred lashes on
        his delicate body, and his flesh was torn and his blood flew as water.
        The whips that were used were made of cow hides; even the mighty ones
        could not bear one lash from it on their bodies, much less, this gentle
        branch. Then the Governor ordered to beat him up to one thousand lashes.
        After he was beaten three hundred more lashes, he said as his Master: "I
        am thirsty." They stopped beating him and informed the Governor who told
        them: "Water him after you tell him forsake your faith." When they came
        to him with the water and told him as the Caliph ordered, Youhanna
        replied with pride and dignity: "Take the water back to him, for I do
        not need it, because My Master Jesus Christ had watered me and quenched
        my thirst." The people who were standing around testified that they saw
        at this moment water dripping from his beard. When he said that, he
        delivered up his soul. When they told the tyrant Governor about his
        death, he ordered them to beat the dead body to complete the one
        thousand lashes, and thus he was martyred, and received the crown of
        martyrdom that was prepared for him by the Great King Jesus Christ. The
        History of the Patriarch did not mention the day that he was martyred,
        but El-Makrizi in his manuscripts said: "The Vizier Fahd Ibn Ibrahim,
        one of the ten men and the companion of Youhanna Ibn Nagaah, was slained
        in the nineteenth of Barmoudah, 719 A.M. (April 14th., 103 A.D.)" The
        martyrdom of the blessed Youhanna Ibn Nagaah was mentioned in the
        History of the Patriarchs, before the mentioning of the martyrdom of the
        Vizier Fahd Ibn Ibrahim. Youhanna, in the feast that he made for his
        friends and kinfolks among whom were the other nine chosen ones, did not
        mention the account of the martyrdom of the Vizier Fahd in what he said
        during the feast. Accordingly, the martyrdom of this Saint was on the
        same day of the martyrdom of the Vizier fahd. His blessings be with us.
        Amen.'

      english: 'This day also marks the commemoration of the martyrdom of the Elder
        the Vizier Abu Elaala Fahd Ibn Ibrahim, who was distinguished in the
        later half of the tenth century and early the eleventh century. He was
        also contemporary to Pope Philotheos, 63rd Patriarch, and from the
        Fatimid Caliphs, Al Emam Al-Azeez Be Allah, and his son Al-Hakim Be-Amr
        Allah. He was an Orthodox Archon, adhered to his faith, faithful to his
        church, and charitable. During his life, he never turned down anyone who
        asked him. Whenever he went through the streets riding and one asked
        him, he would extend the sleeve of his cloak and the one asking would
        find much good in it, and that to hide his virtue of giving. This vizier
        was one of the powerful and influential men of the government during the
        Fatimid Rule. Al-Hakim Be-Amr Allah appointed him head of all the
        scribes and department heads. He built the church of the martyr St.
        Mercurius in the present monastery of Anba Rowais, which was known then
        by Dair El-Khandaq. It is documented in the History of the Patriarchs
        that when Al-Hakim Be-Amr Allah wanted to make the notable Coptic
        scribes apostatize their faith, the Vizier Fahd was one of the ten that
        was chosen for that purpose. He brought him and told him: "You know that
        I have chosen and appointed you ahead of all the men in my government,
        then listen to me and be with me in my religion, so I will promote you
        more than what you are in now and be like a brother to me." When he did
        not answer him, he ordered his neck to be cut off and to burn his body.
        The fire remained burning for three days and the body did not burn, and
        his right hand that he extended to give alms, was sound at all the time
        as the fire never touched it. It was mentioned also in the book of
        El-Khetat El-Tawfikiah that the Vizier Abu Elaala Fahd Ibn Ibrahim was
        discussing the affairs of the government with the head of the army,
        El-Housain Ibn Gawhar, and El-Hakim was luring him to apostatize his
        faith with many promises. When Fahd refused, he ordered his head to be
        cut off and to burn his body but God protected his body from burning. He
        was buried in the southern corner of the church of St. Mercurius, which
        he built in Dair El-khandaq. El-Makrizi wrote in his manuscripts: "Fahd
        Ibn Ibrahim was killed after he had remained as a chief minister of the
        government for five years, nine months and twelve days." God had took
        revenge severely from the wicked people that discredited Abu Elaala Fahd
        before the Caliph and changed his heart against him. Twenty-nine days
        after the departure of Fahd, the wicked man, Aly Ibn Omar Ibn El-addas,
        was killed, then his companion, Taher Mahmoud Ibn El-Nahawy, was killed.
        The church also commemorates the rest of the ten chief ministers that
        the Governor asked them to apostatize their faith. When they refused and
        disobeyed him, he ordered to torture them. They were beaten with whips,
        and when the beating became cruel, four of them became Muslims, one of
        them died the same night, and the other three returned to their
        Christian Faith after the end of the time of persecution. The rest
        departed while they were being tortured and received the crown of
        martyrdom and acquired the eternal life. Their blessings be with us.
        Amen.'
