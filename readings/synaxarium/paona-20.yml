      english: On this day, of the year 3195 of the world, the holy prophet Elisha,
        departed. This prophet was born in one of the villages of Israel called
        Alamut. His father's name was Shaphat. Elisha was a servant to the holy
        prophet Elijah. When the Lord would take up Elijah the prophet into
        heaven, he went with him to the river Jordan. Elijah said to Elisha,
        "Ask what I shall do for you, before I be taken away from you." Elisha
        asked, "I pray you, let a double portion of your spirit be upon me," and
        it was as he asked. (2 Kings 2:1-18) Elisha divided the river and passed
        through it. Then he went to Jericho and went up from there to Bethel;
        and as he was going up the road, some youths came from the city and
        mocked him, and said to him, "Go up, you baldhead! Go up, you baldhead!"
        So he turned around and looked at them, and pronounced a curse on them
        in the name of the LORD. And two female bears came out of the woods and
        mauled forty-two of the youths. (2 Kings 2:23-24) A certain woman of the
        wives of the sons of the prophets cried out to Elisha, saying, "Your
        servant my husband is dead, and the creditor is coming to take my two
        sons to be his slaves." So Elisha said to her, "What shall I do for you?
        Tell me, what do you have in the house?" And she said, "Your maidservant
        has nothing in the house but a jar of oil." Then he said, "Go, borrow
        vessels from everywhere, from all your neighbors; empty vessels; do not
        gather just a few." With his prayers the Lord blessed the oil and all
        the vessels became full. The woman sold the oil and paid off her debt.
        (2 Kings 4:1-7) He also raised the son of the Shunammite woman from the
        dead. When Naaman the Syrian came to him, he healed him from his
        leprosy. Naaman offered him much money and costly clothes, but he
        refused them. Nevertheless, when his servant Gehazi took them for
        himself, the prophet knew that by the spirit. Elisha became angry and
        told him, "Therefore the leprosy of Naaman shall cling to you and your
        descendants forever." Elisha had performed many signs and miracles. He
        prophesied for about fifty years. When Elisha died, they buried him. And
        the raiding bands from Moab invaded the land in the spring of the year.
        So it was, as they were burying a man, a plundering band was seen, and
        they cast the man in the tomb of Elisha; and when the man was let down
        and touched the bones of Elisha, he revived, stood on his feet, and went
        back to his people. (2 Kings 13:20-21) May his prayers be with us and
        Glory be to God forever. Amen.
      arabic: في هذا اليوم من سنة 3195 للعالم تنيح القديس اليشع النبي ولد هذا النبي في
        إحدى قري إسرائيل اسمها علموت واسم أبيه شافاط وكان خادما للقديس ايليا
        النبي . ولما كان وقت صعود ايليا النبي إلى السماء مضي معه إلى الأردن وقال
        له ايليا سلني ما شئت فطلب أن تتضاعف روحه عليه وكان كذلك فحلت عليه روح
        ايليا مضاعفة . وقد شق البحر وعبره . ولما دخل أريحا وخرج منها تبعه صبية
        وكانوا يهزأون به فالتفت إليهم ولعنهم فخرجت دبتان من الوعر افترستا منهم
        اثنين وأربعين ولدا واشتكت له زوجة أحد الأنبياء أن زوجها مات وعليه دين
        والآن يلح في طلبه ولما علم أن عندها قليلا من الزيت طلب منها أن تستعير
        أوعية فارغة كثيرة علي قدر استطاعتها وبصلاته بارك الرب الزيت فامتلأت كل
        الأوعية ثم باعت منه المرأة وسددت دينها كما أقام ابن الشونمية من الموت
        ولما قصده نعمان السرياني أبرأه من برصه فقدم له أموالا كثيرة وثيابا مذهبة
        فلم يقبلها ولما أخذها تلميذه جيحزي لنفسه وعلم النبي بذلك بالروح غضب عليه
        فبرص هو وبنوه وكل نسله وصنع أليشع آيات أخري كثيرة وقد مكث يتنبأ نحو
        الخمسين سنة ولما توفي ووضع في قبر اتفق أن قوما أتوا بميت ووضعوه في هذا
        القبر فلما مس جسد هذا النبي عادت إلى الميت الحياة ورجع إلى أهله .صلاته
        تكون معنا . ولربنا المجد دائما . آمين
