      english: 1. The Martyrdom of St. Colluthus of Antinoe (Known as Abu Colta).
      arabic: 1. نياحة القديس يونياس الرسول
    text:
      english: On this day, St. Colluthus of Antinoe was martyred. He was the son of
        God fearing parents. His father was a governor over Antinoe. He was
        praying to the Lord Jesus to give him a son, and God gave him this
        saint. He taught him the Christian principles and the church doctrine.
        He was pure from his youth. His father wanted him to get married, but he
        did not accept. However, his sister was married to Arianus who became
        the governor after her father. When the Saint's parents departed, he
        built a hostel for the strangers. He also studied medicine and practiced
        it to cure the sick without charging them money. When Diocletian
        apostatized, Arianus the governor followed him to keep his position, and
        started to persecute Christians. Then St. Colluthus rebuked him for
        forsaking the worship of the True God, and the Saint cursed the idols of
        the Emperor. Arianus did not hurt him for the sake of his sister, but he
        sent him to the governor of El-Bahnasa, where he was in prison for three
        years. His sister meditated for his release until another governor took
        over who threatened the saint and tortured him. The angel of the lord
        came to him to comfort and strengthen him. At last, the governor cut off
        his head, and he was granted the crown of Martyrdom. His family prepared
        his body for burial and kept him in a place until the end of the
        persecution, when they built a church for him. Many miracles appeared
        from his body. The saint has a church from antiquity in "Refa" near
        Assuit. A memorial is celebrated every year on the day of his martyrdom.
        The visitors who come are blessed by the saint and his intercessions,
        For they are healed from their sicknesses. It is worth it to mention
        that this church contains a stone which has a great influence to keep
        scorpions away until this day. May his prayers be with us, Amen.
      arabic: في مثل هذا اليوم تنيح القديس يونياس أحد السبعين رسولا . ولد هذا الرسول
        في بيت جبريل من سبط يهوذا . فانتخبه الرب من ضمن السبعين رسولا . وقبل

      english: 2. The Departure of the most honored Layman Ibrahim El-Gohari.
      arabic: 2. استشهاد القديس يوليانوس وأمه بالإسكندرية
    text:
      english: "On this day also of the year 1511 A.M. (1795 A.D.), the great layman
        Ibrahim El-Gohari, departed. He was born in the eighteenth century, and
        his parents were poor. His fathers name was Yousef El-Gohari whose trade
        was making clothing in Kalube. They taught him writing and arithmetic,
        and he excelled in them. He used to trans-scribe the religion books, and
        distribute them to the church at his own expense. He brought the books
        to Pope John (Youhanna) the Eighteenth, and 17th patriarch of Alexandria
        Who was enthroned from 1486-1512 A.M. (1769-1796 A.D.) The many books
        presented to the church by Ibrahim El-Gohari got the attention of the
        pope, together with the high cost of transcribing the books and binding
        them. The pope asked Ibrahim about his resource, and Ibrahim revealed to
        them his zealously and his godly life. The pope blessed him saying:\"may
        the lord uplift your name and bless your work, and keep your memory
        forever.\" The relation between Ibrahim El-Gohari and the pope became
        stronger from that time. When he started to work, Ibrahim was a scribe
        to one of the mamalik- The pope mediated with Moalem Rizk the chief
        scribe, and he took him as his private scribe. He continued in his
        position until the end of Ali Bek El-Kebir when Mohammed Abu- El-Daheb
        became the governor, and Ibrahim El-Gohari became the chief scribe of
        all of egypt, a position which is equal to prime minister today. Ibrahim
        El-Gohari became more humble, generous, and charitable. He attracted to
        him the hearts of all the people. Ibrahim then married a righteous woman
        who shared with him his good nature and character. She helped him in his
        charitable deeds, and encouraged him to build and maintain churches. A
        son was born to them whom they called joseph, and a daughter whom they
        called Demiana. They lived in a place called \"Kantaret-ElDekka\". When
        his son grew up, his father prepared for him a private home furnished
        with the est of furniture, and prepared for his wedding day. But God
        chose that his son be with him before his marriage, and Ibrahim was
        greatly grieved. He then closed the home, and it remained closed. The
        death of his son was the most shocking event in his life, but his desire
        to help the widows, the orphans and the poor intensely increased.
        Everyone was so astonished for his endurance, patience, and his great
        control over his disappoint When his wife resented the will of god, St.
        Anthony the great appeared to her in a dream, and comforted her
        saying,\"you must know that god loved your son, and he took him in his
        youth, and he loves his father for a reason, to keep his name pure, for
        the popularity of his father might have caused his son to shame him and
        ruin his reputation. this is a reward from God to your husband for his
        godliness and his righteousness. Be comforted, and continue in your good
        deeds.\" St. Anthony also appeared to Ibrahim El-Gohari, and he
        comforted him and strengthened his faith. When his wife rose up, and
        told her husband about her dream, he told her that he also saw the same
        dream that same night. They surrendered their will to god, and they
        changed their mourning clothes , and put on regular clothes. Their
        hearts were filled with comfort, and continued in their good and
        charitable deeds. Their Daughter Demiana also died shortly afterwards
        and she was a young virgin. Ibrahim El-Gohari remained in his office
        until a coup occurred which forced Ibrahim Bek and Murad Bek together
        with Ibrahim El-Gohari to flee to upper egypt. The new Governor Hasan
        Qubtan persecuted the copts and forbade them to ride horses with
        saddles, and forbade them to use moslems as servants in their homes, and
        did not allow them to buy slaves. The copts responded by hiding in their
        homes and not leaving for many days. He also ordered to have an account
        of the endowments that Ibrahim El- Gohary's wife hid herself in a moslem
        home to which her had made great favors. But some of those who did not
        honor his favors, betrayed him by telling his wile was hiding. the
        governor forced her to tell him about the places they hied their
        possessions, and they confiscated all the silver and gold utensils and
        their horses saddles, and sold them for low prices. Some also Guided the
        governor to the house of his son which was looked after his death, and
        they also confiscated all its contents of furniture, and took them many
        days to sell them for they were plenty. The governor was called back to
        istanbul, and Ibrahim Bek and Mourad Bek returned to cairo on August 7,
        1791 A.D. and Ibrahim El-Gohari returned to his former position, but he
        did not continue for more than four years, and he was loved by everyone.
        The people called Ibrahim El-Gohari the \"The Sultan of the Copts\" as
        it is indicated on the iconstasis of one of the churches in the
        monastery of St. Paula in the eastern desert, and also in the
        \"Katamares\" kept in the same monastery. The famous historian
        El-Gabarty said about him: \"He had made Egypt great by his capability
        which endured for long time. He was one of the great world statesmen
        with a great decisive mind. He treated everyone according to their
        abilities, and did things that attracted the hearts and the love of the
        people to him. In Ramadan, he used to send gifts to prominent and
        non-prominent moslems. In his days, many churches and monasteries were
        built and maintained, and many endowment of the best of land were given,
        with the necessary provisions and salaries. Anba Yousab the bishop of
        Girga and Ekhmim said about him: \"He was one of the great people of his
        day, who was God-loving, giving all his possessions to the poor, and
        caring about the construction of churches. He loved all people of
        different religions, making peace with all, filling all the needs of
        everyone without prejudice.\" His religious work is as follows: Ibrahim
        El-Gohari was famous for his love of the construction of churches and
        monasteries, and repairing what was destroyed by the evil hands. Because
        of his influential position in the government, and his great favor to
        the moslem rulers, he was able to issue regulations (Fatawi) to permit
        Copts to rebuild the destroyed churches and monasteries. He also donated
        many endowment of good land and money for the reconstruction, that
        amounted to 238 endowments as documented in the patriarchate. He was
        also popular for the trans-scrubbing of rare books, and giving them as
        gifts to the churches and monasteries. He was the first to build St.
        Mark cathedral in El-Azbakiya. The Copts were not allowed to build new
        churches or to repair the old ones, unless they get permission from the
        government, which were rarely granted. One of the princesses came from
        Istanboul (Estana) on a pilgrimage to Mecca passing by Egypt, Ibrahim
        El-Gohari made everything possible to her comfort during her stay, and
        offered her many gifts. She wanted to reward him, and he asked her to
        get an order from the Sultan (Faraman) to permit the construction of a
        church in El-Azbakiya where he lived, and asked her about some other
        things needed by the Copts. The Sultan issued the permit, but he died
        before the construction of the church, and his brother Girgis El-Gohari
        completed it. In order that the time of prayers be maintained in the
        church of the Virgin in Haret-Zoweila, he built a small church after the
        name of St. Mercurius (Abu-Saifain) beside it. This allowed him and the
        government Christian employees to attend the services and return to
        their work as the government allowed. He also prepared the materials for
        the oil of Chrism (Myroun) from his own money, and his brother Girgis
        carried them to the Pope. In 1499 A.M. (1783 A.D.), Ibrahim El-Gohari
        built all the northern wall of St. Antonios monastery, and built a water
        wheel. He built before that the southern and the western walls in 1498
        A.M. The wall is known until today as El-Gohari's wall. He also
        renovated the building of the church of the Virgin in Haret El-Roum in
        158 A.M. (1792 A.D.). He also built the church of Abu Saifain in the
        monastery of St. Paula in the Eastern desert, and in the monastery of
        El-Baramouse, he built the church of Sts. Apollo and Abib (The church
        was demolished in 1881 A.D. to enlarge the church of St. John). He also
        built palaces to the Lady Virgin in El-Baramouse and the Syrian
        monastery. He also built an extension to the southern end of the
        monastery of El-Baramouse, with a wall around it, and the extension was
        about 2400 square meter. In summary, he built and maintained many
        churches and monasteries. He took care of the monks, and offered many
        offerings, candles, oil, veils, and church books to all the churches of
        Egypt. He also distributed charities among the poor and the needy
        everywhere, and gave them food and clothing. He gave special attention
        to widows and the orphans who had no one to help them, and provided
        monthly provisions for all their needs. his deeds were made known in his
        funeral eulogy by Pope Youannis, the 17th. Patriarch. He departed to his
        eternal home on Monday the 25th of Bashans (today), 1511 A.M. (May
        31st., 1795 A.D.) everyone grieved his departure including the governor
        Ibrahim Bek who walked in his funeral procession to honor him as he had
        honored him before his death. Pope Youannis eulogized him for his great
        love to him. He was buried in the private tomb that he built for himself
        beside the church of St. George in Old Cairo which had an oil lamp that
        was lit day and night. He died without leaving a posterity, but his
        memory lives forever. The society for the revival of the Coptic churches
        in Cairo took action to renovate his tomb in Old cairo, and it has
        become a tourist attraction to all those who have heard about Ibrahim
        and his brother Girgis El-Gohari. May their prayers be with us, and
        glory be to God forever. Amen."
