  english: Psalm 18:34,39
  arabic: "مزامير ١٨:٣٤-٣٩"
text:
  english: He teaches my hands to make war, So that my arms can bend a bow of
    bronze. You have also given me the shield of Your salvation; Your right hand
    has held me up, Your gentleness has made me great. You enlarged my path
    under me, So my feet did not slip. I have pursued my enemies and overtaken
    them; Neither did I turn back again till they were destroyed. I have wounded
    them, So that they could not rise; They have fallen under my feet. For You
    have armed me with strength for the battle; You have subdued under me those
    who rose up against me.
  arabic: الذي يعلم يدي القتال فتحنى بذراعي قوسٌ من نحاسٍ وتجعل لي ترس خلاصك
    ويمينك تعضدني ولطفك يعظمني توسع خطواتي تحتي فلم تتقلقل عقباي أتبع أعدائي
    فأدركهم ولا أرجع حتى أفنيهم أسحقهم فلا يستطيعون القيام يسقطون تحت رجلي
    تمنطقني بقوةٍ للقتال تصرع تحتي القائمين علي
