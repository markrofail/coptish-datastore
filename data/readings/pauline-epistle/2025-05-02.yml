  arabic: رومية ١:١٩-٢١
text:
  english:
    - Because what may be known of God is manifest in them, for God has shown it to them. For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even His eternal power and Godhead, so that they are without excuse, because, although they knew God, they did not glorify Him as God, nor were thankful, but became futile in their thoughts, and their foolish hearts were darkened.
  arabic:
    - إذ معرفة الله ظاهرةٌ فيهم لأن الله أظهرها لهم لأن منذ خلق العالم ترى أموره غير المنظورة وقدرته السرمدية ولاهوته مدركةً بالمصنوعات حتى إنهم بلا عذرٍ لأنهم لما عرفوا الله لم يمجدوه أو يشكروه كإلهٍ بل حمقوا في أفكارهم وأظلم قلبهم الغبي
