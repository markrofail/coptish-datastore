  - english: Now it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these parables, that He departed from there. When He had come to His own country, He taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished and said, "Where did this Man get this wisdom and these mighty works? Is this not the carpenter's son? Is not His mother called Mary? And His brothers James, Joses, Simon, and Judas? And His sisters, are they not all with us? Where then did this Man get all these things?" So they were offended at Him. But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his own country and in his own house." Now He did not do many mighty works there because of their unbelief.
    arabic: 'ولما أكمل يسوع هذه الأمثال انتقل من هناك ولما جاء إلى وطنه كان يعلمهم في مجمعهم حتى بهتوا وقالوا: من أين لهذا هذه الحكمة والقوات أليس هذا ابن النجار أليست أمه تدعى مريم وإخوته يعقوب ويوسي وسمعان ويهوذا أوليست أخواته جميعهن عندنا فمن أين لهذا هذه كلها فكانوا يعثرون به وأما يسوع فقال لهم: ليس نبيٌ بلا كرامةٍ إلا في وطنه وفي بيته ولم يصنع هناك قواتٍ كثيرةً لعدم إيمانهم'
