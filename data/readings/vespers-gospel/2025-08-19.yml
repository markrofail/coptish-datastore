    - 'Now it came to pass, about eight days after these sayings, that He took Peter, John, and James and went up on the mountain to pray. As He prayed, the appearance of His face was altered, and His robe became white and glistening. And behold, two men talked with Him, who were Moses and Elijah, who appeared in glory and spoke of His decease which He was about to accomplish at Jerusalem. But Peter and those with him were heavy with sleep; and when they were fully awake, they saw His glory and the two men who stood with Him. Then it happened, as they were parting from Him, that Peter said to Jesus, "Master, it is good for us to be here; and let us make three tabernacles: one for You, one for Moses, and one for Elijah"--not knowing what he said. While he was saying this, a cloud came and overshadowed them; and they were fearful as they entered the cloud. And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, "This is My beloved Son. Hear Him!" When the voice had ceased, Jesus was found alone. But they kept quiet, and told no one in those days any of the things they had seen.'
  arabic:
    - 'وبعد هذا الكلام بنحو ثمانية أيامٍ أخذ بطرس ويوحنا ويعقوب وصعد إلى جبلٍ ليصلي وفيما هو يصلي صارت هيئة وجهه متغيرةً ولباسه مبيضاً لامعاً وإذا رجلان يتكلمان معه وهما موسى وإيليا اللذان ظهرا بمجدٍ وتكلما عن خروجه الذي كان عتيداً أن يكمله في أورشليم وأما بطرس واللذان معه فكانوا قد تثقلوا بالنوم فلما استيقظوا رأوا مجده والرجلين الواقفين معه وفيما هما يفارقانه قال بطرس ليسوع: يا معلم جيدٌ أن نكون ههنا فلنصنع ثلاث مظال: لك واحدةً ولموسى واحدةً ولإيليا واحدةً وهو لا يعلم ما يقول وفيما هو يقول ذلك كانت سحابةٌ فظللتهم فخافوا عندما دخلوا في السحابة وصار صوتٌ من السحابة قائلاً: هذا هو ابني الحبيب له اسمعوا ولما كان الصوت وجد يسوع وحده وأما هم فسكتوا ولم يخبروا أحداً في تلك الأيام بشيءٍ مما أبصروه'
