  english:
    - Now He arose from the synagogue and entered Simon's house. But Simon's wife's mother was sick with a high fever, and they made request of Him concerning her. So He stood over her and rebuked the fever, and it left her. And immediately she arose and served them. When the sun was setting, all those who had any that were sick with various diseases brought them to Him; and He laid His hands on every one of them and healed them. And demons also came out of many, crying out and saying, "You are the Christ, the Son of God!" And He, rebuking them, did not allow them to speak, for they knew that He was the Christ.
  arabic:
    - 'ولما قام من المجمع دخل بيت سمعان وكانت حماة سمعان قد أخذتها حمى شديدةٌ فسألوه من أجلها فوقف فوقها وانتهر الحمى فتركتها وفي الحال قامت وصارت تخدمهم وعند غروب الشمس جميع الذين كان عندهم سقماء بأمراضٍ مختلفةٍ قدموهم إليه فوضع يديه على كل واحدٍ منهم وشفاهم وكانت شياطين أيضاً تخرج من كثيرين وهي تصرخ وتقول: أنت المسيح ابن الله فانتهرهم ولم يدعهم يتكلمون لأنهم عرفوه أنه المسيح'
