    - Now when Jesus had crossed over again by boat to the other side, a great multitude gathered to Him; and He was by the sea. And behold, one of the rulers of the synagogue came, Jairus by name. And when he saw Him, he fell at His feet and begged Him earnestly, saying, "My little daughter lies at the point of death. Come and lay Your hands on her, that she may be healed, and she will live." So Jesus went with him, and a great multitude followed Him and thronged Him. Now a certain woman had a flow of blood for twelve years, and had suffered many things from many physicians. She had spent all that she had and was no better, but rather grew worse. When she heard about Jesus, she came behind Him in the crowd and touched His garment. For she said, "If only I may touch His clothes, I shall be made well." Immediately the fountain of her blood was dried up, and she felt in her body that she was healed of the affliction. And Jesus, immediately knowing in Himself that power had gone out of Him, turned around in the crowd and said, "Who touched My clothes?" But His disciples said to Him, "You see the multitude thronging You, and You say, "Who touched Me?"' And He looked around to see her who had done this thing. But the woman, fearing and trembling, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell down before Him and told Him the whole truth. And He said to her, "Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace, and be healed of your affliction." While He was still speaking, some came from the ruler of the synagogue's house who said, "Your daughter is dead. Why trouble the Teacher any further?" As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken, He said to the ruler of the synagogue, "Do not be afraid; only believe." And He permitted no one to follow Him except Peter, James, and John the brother of James. Then He came to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and saw a tumult and those who wept and wailed loudly. When He came in, He said to them, "Why make this commotion and weep? The child is not dead, but sleeping." And they ridiculed Him. But when He had put them all outside, He took the father and the mother of the child, and those who were with Him, and entered where the child was lying. Then He took the child by the hand, and said to her, "Talitha, cumi," which is translated, "Little girl, I say to you, arise." Immediately the girl arose and walked, for she was twelve years of age. And they were overcome with great amazement. But He commanded them strictly that no one should know it, and said that something should be given her to eat.

    - 'ولما اجتاز يسوع في السفينة أيضاً إلى العبر اجتمع إليه جمعٌ كثيرٌ وكان عند البحر وإذا واحدٌ من رؤساء المجمع اسمه يايرس جاء ولما رآه خر عند قدميه وطلب إليه كثيراً قائلاً: ابنتي الصغيرة على آخر نسمةٍ ليتك تأتي وتضع يدك عليها لتشفى فتحيا فمضى معه وتبعه جمعٌ كثيرٌ وكانوا يزحمونه وامرأةٌ بنزف دمٍ منذ اثنتي عشرة سنةً وقد تألمت كثيراً من أطباء كثيرين وأنفقت كل ما عندها ولم تنتفع شيئاً بل صارت إلى حالٍ أردأ - لما سمعت بيسوع جاءت في الجمع من وراءٍ ومست ثوبه لأنها قالت: إن مسست ولو ثيابه شفيت فللوقت جف ينبوع دمها وعلمت في جسمها أنها قد برئت من الداء فللوقت التفت يسوع بين الجمع شاعراً في نفسه بالقوة التي خرجت منه وقال: من لمس ثيابي فقال له تلاميذه: أنت تنظر الجمع يزحمك وتقول من لمسني وكان ينظر حوله ليرى التي فعلت هذا وأما المرأة فجاءت وهي خائفةٌ ومرتعدةٌ عالمةً بما حصل لها فخرت وقالت له الحق كله فقال لها: يا ابنة إيمانك قد شفاك اذهبي بسلامٍ وكوني صحيحةً من دائك وبينما هو يتكلم جاءوا من دار رئيس المجمع قائلين: ابنتك ماتت لماذا تتعب المعلم بعد فسمع يسوع لوقته الكلمة التي قيلت فقال لرئيس المجمع: لا تخف آمن فقط ولم يدع أحداً يتبعه إلا بطرس ويعقوب ويوحنا أخا يعقوب فجاء إلى بيت رئيس المجمع ورأى ضجيجاً يبكون ويولولون كثيراً فدخل وقال لهم: لماذا تضجون وتبكون لم تمت الصبية لكنها نائمةٌ فضحكوا عليه أما هو فأخرج الجميع وأخذ أبا الصبية وأمها والذين معه ودخل حيث كانت الصبية مضطجعةً وأمسك بيد الصبية وقال لها: طليثا قومي الذي تفسيره: يا صبية لك أقول قومي وللوقت قامت الصبية ومشت لأنها كانت ابنة اثنتي عشرة سنةً فبهتوا بهتاً عظيماً فأوصاهم كثيراً أن لا يعلم أحدٌ بذلك وقال أن تعطى لتأكل'
