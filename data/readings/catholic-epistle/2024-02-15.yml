  english: 'And this is the word that was preached to you. Therefore, rid
    yourselves of all malice and all deceit, hypocrisy, envy, and slander of
    every kind. Like newborn babies, crave pure spiritual milk, so that by it
    you may grow up in your salvation, now that you have tasted that the Lord is
    good. As you come to him, the living Stone--rejected by men but chosen by
    God and precious to him-- you also, like living stones, are being built into
    a spiritual house to be a holy priesthood, offering spiritual sacrifices
    acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. For in Scripture it says: "See, I
    lay a stone in Zion, a chosen and precious cornerstone, and the one who
    trusts in him will never be put to shame." Now to you who believe, this
    stone is precious. But to those who do not believe, "The stone the builders
    rejected has become the capstone," and, "A stone that causes men to stumble
    and a rock that makes them fall." They stumble because they disobey the
    message--which is also what they were destined for. But you are a chosen
    people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people belonging to God, that
    you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his
    wonderful light. Once you were not a people, but now you are the people of
    God; once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy.'
