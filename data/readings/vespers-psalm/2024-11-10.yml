  - english: Then the channels of the sea were seen, The foundations of the world were uncovered At Your rebuke, O LORD, At the blast of the breath of Your nostrils. In my distress I called upon the LORD, And cried out to my God; He heard my voice from His temple, And my cry came before Him, even to His ears.
    arabic: فظهرت أعماق المياه وانكشفت أسس المسكونة من زجرك يا رب من نسمة ريح أنفك في ضيقي دعوت الرب وإلى إلهي صرخت فسمع من هيكله صوتي وصراخي قدامه دخل أذنيه
