    text:
      english: "On this day of the last year of king Cyrus King of Babylon, the great
        righteous prophet Daniel Departed. This prophet was from the tribe of
        Judah, and from the posterity of king David. He was taken captive along
        with the Israelites by Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon when he captured
        Jerusalem in the year 3398 of the world. He stayed in babylon for
        seventy years. This prophet was very young in age, however, he conducted
        himself in virtuous life, the Holy Spirit filled him and he prophesied
        in Babylon. In the fourth year of the exile, Nebuchadnezzar the king saw
        a dreadful dream and was extremely frightened. When he woke up, he
        forgot the detail of his dream. He gathered all the wise men of Babylon
        to tell the king his dream and its meaning. If they failed to tell the
        king the dream and its interpretation they would all be killed, among
        those also were Daniel and the three young men. Daniel and the young men
        prayed to God with supplications to reveal to them the King's dream. God
        answered their prayers and revealed to Daniel the dream and its
        interpretation. Daniel went to the king and told him his dream and its
        interpretation. He also told him about the kings that they are about to
        rule after him, and what would happen to every one of them.
        Nebuchadnezzar was pleased with Daniel, and fell on his face before him.
        The king presented Daniel with great gifts and appointed him over the
        wise men of Babylon. After some time had passed, Nebuchadnezzar saw
        another dream, and Daniel interpreted the dream for him. Daniel told the
        king that because of his arrogance, God would drive him from among men,
        to dwell among the beasts of the wild and would eat grass like oxen for
        seven years, and then God would bring him back to his kingdom, and all
        that happened to Nebuchadnezzar. Daniel also explained to Belshazzar,
        the son of Nebuchadnezzar, what the angel of the Lord had written on the
        wall, when king Belshazzar drank wine in the gold and silver vessels of
        the temple of the Lord. Daniel told the king: \" O king, the Most High
        gave Nebuchadnezzar your father, a kingdom and majesty, glory and
        honor... But when his heart was lifted up in pride, he was deposed from
        his kingdom and thrown from his throne into among the animals. And you,
        Belshazzar, although you knew all what happened to your father, yet you
        also lifted your heart against the Lord of heaven. They brought the
        vessels of the house of the Lord before you, and you , your lords, wives
        and concubines (mistresses) drank wine from these vessels... Then the
        fingers of a Hand were send from the Lord, and His writing was written:
        \"Mene, Mene, Tekel, and Upharsin..which meant: Mene means: God has
        numbered your days as a king and terminated you rule. Tekel means: You
        have been weighed in the balances of the Lord and was found wanting.
        Upharsin means: your kingdom has been divided and given to the Medes and
        Persians after you. All of them came to pass and the king was killed
        with all his lords and the kingdom of the Chaldeans ended. Darius, king
        of Persia, ruled after him. There was an idol in Babylon named \"Bael\"
        which king Darius worshiped. When Daniel was asked why he did not
        worship it, Daniel answered: \"I do not worship something that has no
        life in it.\" The king said to him: \"He is alive for he eats and drinks
        every day.\" Daniel told him that could not be true. The king was angry
        and wanted to check the matter for himself. He put the food and the
        drinks in the temple of the idol and closed the door and sealed it. On
        the next day, he went to the temple, opened the door and did not find
        the food nor the drinks. But Daniel with the help of some of his
        companions, covered the floor of the temple with fine ashes, found the
        feet tracks of those who entered the temple by night and stole the food
        and drinks. The king arrested the seventy priests of the idol Bael,
        together with their wives and children and tortured them until they told
        him about the secret entrance to the temple. The king then ordered them
        all to be killed and allowed Daniel to destroy the idol and its altar.
        The people rebelled against the king and asked him to deliver Daniel to
        their hands. The king surrendered to their demands and Daniel was cast
        into the den of lions. However God kept Daniel safe and destroyed his
        enemies. Daniel saw in a vision the kingdoms and the kings to come after
        him to rule the world to the end of time. He also saw the glory of God
        and the Divinity of Christ the Savior. He prophesied about His coming
        and His death, the destruction of Jerusalem, and the abolition of the
        sacrifice and the offerings, and all has been fulfilled. This great
        prophet remained in Babylon for seventy years, then departed in peace.
        May his prayers be with us, and glory be to God for ever. Amen."
