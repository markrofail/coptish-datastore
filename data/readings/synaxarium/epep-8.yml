      english: 1. The Departure of St. Anba Bishoy.
      arabic: 1. نياحة القديس العظيم الانبا بيشوى كوكب البرية
    text:
      english: On this day, St. Bishoy, whose memorial is honorable, the star of the
        desert, departed. He was born in a town called Shansa in Egypt, and he
        had six brothers. His mother saw an angel in a vision saying to her,
        "The Lord says to you, give Me one of your children to serve Me." She
        answered, "Lord, take whoever you want." The angel took the hand of Anba
        Bishoy, who was thin and his body was frail. His mother told the angel,
        "My Lord, take one who is strong to serve the Lord." "This is whom the
        Lord has chosen," answered the Angel. Later on, St. Bishoy went to the
        wilderness of Shiheet and became a monk by the hand of Anba Bemwah
        (Bamouyah), who also ordained St. John "Yehness" the Short a monk. St.
        Bishoy struggled in much asceticism and many worships that made him
        worthy to see the Lord Christ. Emperor Constantine appeared to him in a
        vision, saying, "Had I known how great is the honor of monks, I would
        have abandoned my kingdom and became a monk." St. Bishoy told him, "You
        have banished the heathen worship and exalted Christianity, and has not
        Christ given you anything?" Emperor Constantine answered him, "The Lord
        has given me many gifts, but none of them is like the honor of the
        monks." During his days, an ascetic old man appeared in the mountain of
        Ansena, who was reputed for his righteousness and to whom many people
        gathered. But he deviated from the true faith and the devil lead him
        astray. He taught that there is no Holy Spirit, and many were deceived
        by his sayings. Anba Bishoy heard about him, and he went to him and he
        had with him a weaved basket with three ears. When he visited the old
        man and his followers, they asked him about the reason for making three
        ears for the basket. He answered, "I have a Trinity, and everything I
        do, is like the Trinity." They said to him, "Then, Is there a thing
        called the Holy Spirit?" Then he started to explain to them from the
        Holy Scriptures, from the Old and New Testaments. He indicated to them
        that the Holy Spirit is One of the three Persons of the Trinity. He
        convinced them, and they returned to the true faith. Then he returned to
        his monastery in the wilderness of Scete (Shiheet). When the barbarians
        invaded the wilderness, he left it and dwelt on Mount Ansena, where he
        departed. After the time of persecution had ended, they brought his body
        with the body of St. Paul of Tamouh to his monastery in the wilderness
        of Shiheet. May his prayers be with us. Amen.

      english: 2. The Martyrdom of St. Piroou and St. Athom.
      arabic: 2. استشهاد القديس ابيرو وادوم وبلانا
    text:
      english: On this day also, St. Piroou and St. Athom were martyred. These two
        Saints were born in the city of "Sonbat", of Christian parents who were
        righteous, loving works of righteousness and charitable deeds. Their
        father's name was John and their mother's was Mary. St. Piroou was blond
        with curled hair, tall in stature, with blue eyes. St. Athom was tall in
        stature with white complexion, dark eyes and black beard. When Piroou
        was thirty years old, and Athom was twenty-seven, they attended church
        consistently during masses, and continued to give alms and provide
        shelter for strangers. When persecution was incited against the
        Christians, they took some goods and went to the town of El-Farma to
        trade there. They found the body of a Saint called "Noua" with some of
        the soldiers. They bought the body from them with silver, placed the
        body in a marbled sarcophagus in their own home. They hung an oil lamb
        before it, and many miracles appeared from the body. The two saints
        reflected upon the vanity of the world, and the blessings of paradise.
        They distributed their money among the poor, went to Alexandria and
        confessed Christ before the Governor. He tortured them by beating and
        whipping them until their blood poured out on the ground. They hanged
        them and put fire under them. The Angel of the Lord came and brought
        them down and healed their wounds. Then, the Governor sent them to
        El-Farma. When the Governor of El-Farma saw their courage and the beauty
        of their appearance, he offered them the worship of the idols. When they
        refused, he pulled out the nails of their hands and feet. Then he put
        them on iron rods and lit fire under them. During this, the wife of the
        Governor died, and he asked the two Saints to forgive him for what he
        had done to them. They prayed to God for her and God raised her from the
        dead. The Governor and every one with him believed. He released the two
        Saints and they returned to their town "Sonbat". They gave the poor
        whatever was left of their money. They gave the body of St. Noua to a
        righteous man called Sarabamon. They asked him to hang an oil lamp
        before it at all times. Then, they went to the Governor and confessed
        Christ. He ordered them beaten and dragged in the city until their blood
        poured out on the ground. A deaf and dumb woman took some of the blood
        and anointed her ears and tongue with it. Instantly she was healed. She
        glorified the Lord Christ and confessed Him. The Governor ordered them
        all to be beheaded. They all received the crown of martyrdom. The
        righteous Sarabamon, and some people from Sonbat were present. They took
        the bodies of the two Saints, shrouded them, and took them to their
        town. A church was built for them, where their bodies and the body of
        St. Noua were placed. It was said that their bodies are now located in
        the church of St. Barbara in Old Cairo. May their prayers be with us,
        Amen.

      english: On this day also, St. Balanah the priest, was martyred. He was from the
        city of Bara, of the diocese of Sakha. When he heard of the persecution
        of the faithful and the slaying of the saints, he distributed all his
        money to the poor and the needy. He then went to "Antinoe" (Ansena), and
        confessed the Lord Christ before the governor. He tortured St. Balanah
        much with different kinds of tortures until he delivered up his soul in
        the hands of the Lord. May his prayers be with us, Amen.

      english: This day also, marks the martyrdom of St. Epime (Pimanon) (Bima). He
        was the chief of the village of "Panokleus" of the district of
        El-Bahnasa. He was rich and merciful to the poor. The Lord Christ
        appeared to him in a vision and told him, "Arise, go to the Governor and
        confess My Name, for there you have a crown prepared for you." When he
        awoke from his sleep, he distributed all his money to the poor and the
        needy. Then he prayed, and went to El-Bahnasa, and confessed the Lord
        Christ. When he confessed that he was the chief of the village, the
        Governor asked him about the vessels of the church in his town, and
        offered him the worship of the idols. St. Bima answered him saying, "I
        will not give you the vessels, and as for worshipping the idols, I only
        worship my Lord Jesus Christ." The Governor ordered his tongue cut off,
        and torture by the press and by burning. But the Lord saved and healed
        him. The Governor then, sent him to Alexandria, where he was imprisoned.
        Julius El-Akfahsi (the writer of the biographies of the saints) had a
        sister possessed with an evil spirit. This Saint prayed for her and she
        was healed. The report of this miracle spread out and many believed. The
        Governor became furious and he tortured the Saint with the press and by
        pulling out his nails. The Lord strengthened him and healed him. When
        the Governor became weary of torturing him, he sent him to Upper Egypt.
        There he was beheaded, and he received the crown of martyrdom. The
        servants of Julius El-Akfahsi carried his body to his town. May his
        prayers be with us, Amen.

      english: 5. The Departure of Cyrus (Karas), brother of Emperor Theodosius.
      arabic: ""
    text:
      english: Today also, St. Cyrus (Karas) departed. He was the brother of Emperor
        Theodosius the Great. This saint knew well the vanity of the world and
        its temporal nature. He left all his possessions and went out wandering
        without a destination. God guided him to the inner Western Wilderness,
        where he lived for many years alone, without seeing man or beast. There
        was in the wilderness of Shiheet (Scete) a holy priest called Bamwa
        (Pimwah) who shrouded the body of St. Hilaria. This father longed to see
        one of the servants of Christ, the hermits. The Lord helped him until he
        came to the inner wilderness, and he saw many of the saints. Everyone of
        them told him about his name, and the reason he came to the wilderness.
        But St. Pimwah asked each of them, "Is there is anyone who lives further
        in the inner desert?" They answered him, "Yes." He continued to walk
        until he finally arrived at St. Karas, the last one of them. St. Karas
        called him from inside his cell, "Welcome, Anba Pimwah, the priest of
        Shiheet." Anba Pimwah entered his cell, and after the greetings, St.
        Karas asked him about the news of the world, the governors and the
        faithful. At night, St. Karas prayed for a long time, then he knelt to
        the ground and delivered up his soul in the hands of the Lord. Anba
        Pimwah buried him in his cloak, then he returned glorifying God, telling
        everyone about the Saint and his strife. May his prayers be with us and
        Glory be to God forever, Amen.
