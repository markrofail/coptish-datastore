      english: 1. Consecration of The Church of Saint Macarius the Great
      arabic: 1. نياحة البابا ثاؤناس ال16
    text:
      english: On this day, the church of St. Macarius, in the monastery known after
        his name, was consecrated by the hand of Abba Benjamin, 38th Pope of
        Alexandria. This took place when El-Moquakas was appointed as a ruler
        and patriarch over Egypt by Emperor Heraclius. Both of them believed in
        the teachings of the Council of Chalcedon. El-Moquakas started to
        persecute the Christians of Egypt (the Copts) because they refused to
        follow him. He pursued Pope Benjamin, the legitimate Pope of Alexandria,
        who took flight to Upper Egypt. He moved from one church to another and
        from one monastery to another, confirming his flock in the faith. He did
        this for ten years, until the Arab conquest of Egypt and the death of
        El-Moquakas. When Abba Benjamin returned to his throne, the elders of
        the wilderness of the holy desert of Scete (Scetis) asked him to
        consecrate for them the new church that they built there in the name of
        St. Macarius. He went with them joyfully. As he approached the
        monastery, the monks received him with palm fronds and olive branches,
        just as the city of Jerusalem received Christ when He entered it. When
        he was consecrating the church and as he was starting to consecrate the
        altar, he saw the Hand of Christ anointing the altar with him. He fell
        upon his face in great fear, and one of the Cherubim raised him up and
        comforted him. Abba Benjamin said, 'Truly this is the house of the Lord
        and this is the door of heaven.' He looked to the west side of the
        church and he saw an elder standing there with reverence and awesome
        appearance, and his shining face looked like an angel. He said to
        himself, 'Truly, if there a chair became vacant, I would make this man a
        bishop.' The angel told him, 'Would you make this man a bishop?, and he
        is St. Macarius, the father of Patriarchs, bishops, and all the monks.
        He has come today in the spirit to rejoice with his children, and this
        place will be forever filled with righteous monks, and it will never be
        short of leaders and spiritual fruits.' St. Benjamin said, 'Blessed is
        he and blessed are his children.' The angel said, 'If his children obey
        his commandments and follow his orders, they will be with him in glory,
        but if they disobey, they will have no share with him.' Then St.
        Macarius said, 'Do not decide, my lord, what would happen to my children
        this way. For if one grape in a bunch remains, the blessing of the Lord
        will be on it. For if their love for one another remains among them, I
        believe that the Lord will never keep them away from His Kingdom.' St.
        Benjamin was amazed and marveled at the abundant mercy of St. Macarius.
        He wrote what had taken place and placed it in the church as a perpetual
        memorial. He asked the Lord Jesus Christ that his departure might take
        place on a similar day. This was fulfilled, and he departed on the
        eighth day of Tubah, after he had been on the throne for 39 years. The
        altar in which he saw the Lord Christ was named after him. May his
        prayers be with us. Amen.
      arabic: في مثل هذا اليوم من سنة 300 م تتيح القديس ثاؤنا بابا الإسكندرية السادس
        عشر وكان هذا القديس عالما تقيا وديعا رقيقا محبا للجميع . بروح المودة
        واللطف تمكن من تشييد كنيسة بالإسكندرية علي اسم العذراء البتول والدة
        الإله . إذ أن المؤمنين كانوا حتى زمانه يصلون ويقدسون في البيوت والمغائر
        خوفا من غير المؤمنين الذين ظل يلاطفهم لينال رغباته وقد رد كثيرين منهم
        إلى الإيمان بالسيد المسيح وعمدهم. وقد عمد في السنة الأولى من رياسته
        القديس بطرس الذي خلفه علي كرسي مار مرقس وهو البابا السابع عشر وقد قيل
        انه رسمه اغنسطسا وهو لم يزل بعد في الخامسة من عمره ثم رقاه شماسا في
        الثانية عشرة وقسا في السادسة عشرة . وفي زمان هذا الأب ظهر بالإسكندرية
        رجل اسمه سبيليوس كان يعلم أن الأب والابن والروح القدس إقنوم واحد . فحرمه
        وابطل قوله بالبرهان المقنع ولما اكمل سعيه تنبح بسلام بعد ان أقام علي
        الكرسي تسع عشرة سنة. صلاته تكون معنا امين

      english: Departure of Pope Andronicus I (616-622) the 37th Patriarch of
        Alexandria and the See of Saint Mark
      arabic: 2. استشهاد القديس غللييكوس اسقف أوسيم
    text:
      english: Also on this day, of the year 622 A.D., the holy father Abba
        Andronicus, 37th Pope of Alexandria, departed. This father was from a
        rich family of great influence and his cousin was the chief of the
        imperial court at Alexandria. He was very well educated and he studied
        the Holy Scriptures and excelled in their interpretation. Because of his
        knowledge, his righteousness and his charity toward the poor, he was
        ordained a deacon. By consensus he was chosen to be patriarch, although
        he never lived in any monastery. He remained in Alexandria all the days
        of his papacy, not intimidated by the authority of the Melkites. Shortly
        after the ordination of Abba Andronicus, the Persians invaded the East
        and crossed the river Euphrates. They seized Halab, Antioch in Syria,
        Jerusalem, and many other cities. They killed and imprisoned many
        Christians. They captured Egypt and went to the City of Alexandria,
        around which there were six hundred inhabited monasteries. They killed
        all the inhabitants, plundered their possessions, and destroyed the
        monasteries. When the people of Alexandria heard what they had done,
        because of their fear, they opened the gates of the city for them. The
        Persian King saw in a night dream someone saying to him, 'I have
        delivered to you the city. Do not destroy it. But kill its heroes for
        they are hypocrites.' He arrested the Governor of the city, and tied him
        up in chains. He ordered the elders of the city to bring forth the men,
        from 18 to 50 years old to come forward to give everyone twenty denari,
        and to enlist them as soldiers for the city. Eighty thousand men came
        forward and he killed them all by the sword. Afterward, the Persian King
        went with his army to Upper Egypt. He passed by the city of Nikios. He
        heard that there were some seven hundred monks living in cells and caves
        around it. He sent men to kill them. He continued to kill and destroy
        until Emperor Heraclius conquered him and drove him out of Egypt. As for
        Pope Andronicus, he lived a virtuous life. He remained on the throne of
        St. Mark for 6 years, then departed in peace. May His prayers be with
        us. Amen.
      arabic: في مثل هذا اليوم استشهد القديس غللينيكوس أسقف أوسيم . وذلك انه لما علم
        الملك دقلديانوس ان غللينيكوس يعلم الناس ان يبتعدوا عن عبادة الأوثان أرسل
        إليه رسلا ليقبضوا عليه ويعذبوه ، فلما سمع القديس بقدوم رسل الملك ، جمع
        شعب ابروشيته إلى مدينة أوسيم مقر كرسيه وأقام قداسا وناولهم من جسد الرب
        ودمه الأقدسين وقال لهم أنكم لا ترون وجهي بعد ، فبكي الشعب بكاء مرا ولم
        يقدروا ان يمنعوه من لقاء الجند ثم خرج واسلم نفسه إليهم فأخذوه وسلموه
        لاريانوس والي انصنا ، فعذبه بأنواع العذاب وكان الرب يشفيه ويقويه ، ثم
        أخذه الوالي معه إلى مدينة قاو وهناك عذبه ايضا ولما ضجر من تعذيبه أمر ان
        تشق يده حتى كفه ثم أخذه بعد ذلك معه في سفينة إلى طوخ ولما شعر القديس
        بدنو اجله وهو في السفينة أوصى نوتيا مؤمنا قائلا له إذا مت فعند وصولنا
        البر اطرح جسدي علي تل ولما تنبح طرح النوتي جسد القديس كما أمره وإذا قوم
        مؤمنين قد أتوا باسم الرب فاخذوا جسد القديس وكفنوه وأخفوه عندهم إلى ان
        انقضي زمن الاضطهاد . صلاته تكون معنا ولربنا المجد دائما ابديا امين .

      english: Departure of Pope Benjamin I (622-659) the 38th Patriarch of Alexandria
        and the See of Saint Mark
      arabic: 3. نياحة القديس انبا ثاؤنا
    text:
      english: On this day also, of the year 659 A.D., the blessed and holy father
        Abba Benjamin, 38th Pope of Alexandria, departed. This father was from
        the city of Barset (Barshout), the province of El-Behiera. He was the
        son of wealthy parents. He became a monk under the guidance of a holy
        elder by the name of Theonas in the monastery of St. Knobus nearby
        Alexandria. He grew in virtue and memorized the holy books of the church
        until he reached the level of Christian perfection. One night he heard
        in a night vision someone saying, 'Rejoice Benjamin, for you will
        shepherd the flock of Christ.' When he told his spiritual father about
        what he had heard, he said to him, 'The devil wants to hinder you.
        Beware of pride.' He increased in virtue. His spiritual father took him
        to Pope Andronicus and told him about Abba Benjamin's vision. The Pope
        ordained him priest and put him in charge of the church affairs, and he
        excelled in his care. When he was chosen to the patriarchate, he faced
        many tribulations. The angel of the Lord had revealed to him the
        hardships that the church was about to experience. The angel told him to
        flee with his bishops. St. Benjamin celebrated the Divine Liturgy and
        administered the Holy Mysteries to the people. He also commanded them to
        be steadfast in the faith of their fathers and informed them of what was
        about to happen. He wrote a circular to all the bishops and all the
        heads of the monasteries, advising them to hide until the hardships were
        over. Then he went to the wilderness of St. Macarius, then to Upper
        Egypt. After the Pope had left Alexandria, the Chalcedonian El-Moquakas
        arrived, and took charge over the country and seized the church with
        authority from Emperor Heraclius. He persecuted the believers and
        arrested 'Mina', St. Benjamin's brother, and tortured him severely. Then
        he burnt his sides, and finally killed him by drowning him. Shortly
        after, Amr Ebn-Elas invaded the land of Egypt and stayed there for three
        years. In 360 A.M. (Anno Martyri), Amr went to Alexandria and gained
        control of its fortress. Many evil men took the chance and burned many
        churches, among them was St. Mark's Church on the seashore, and many
        other monasteries that were surrounding Alexandria, and plundered their
        contents. One of the sailors went to the church of St. Mark during this
        disturbance and he thrust his hand into the sarcophagus of St. Mark,
        thinking that he would find money. He did not find anything except a
        body. He stole the clothing that was on it and took the head with him,
        and hid it in his ship and did not tell anyone. When Amr Ebn-Elas knew
        about the disappearance of Pope Benjamin, he sent a circular to all the
        cities of Egypt, giving orders that the Pope's hiding place be safe and
        secure. He asked the Pope to come back to his people and to take charge
        of the church. Pope Benjamin came back after he had been in hiding for
        13 years. Amr Ebn-Elas was courteous toward him and honored him. He
        returned the churches and all their properties back to him. When Amr was
        about to leave Alexandria, heading to Pentapolis (the five western
        cities), one of the ships could not move and was unable to leave. The
        captain of the ship was questioned and when they searched the ship they
        found the head of St. Mark. They called upon Pope Benjamin and he
        carried it and walked with the priests and the people while they were
        joyfully singing hymns, until they arrived to Alexandria. The captain of
        the ship paid a great amount of money to the Pope to build a church
        after the name of St. Mark. This father was dedicated to converting the
        unbelievers to the Christian faith. He departed in peace after he had
        been on the apostolic throne for 37 years. May His prayers be with us
        and Glory be to our God forever. Amen.
