      english: 'On this day also, is the commemoration of Samson, one of the Judges of
        Israel. The name of the father of this righteous was Manoah from the
        tribe of Dan, and his mother was barren. The angel of the Lord appeared
        to her and announced her of his birth, and commanded her not to drink
        wine nor to eat unclean food all the days of her pregnancy. The angel
        also commanded her that no razor should come on his head, for the child
        was to be a Nazirite (dedicated) unto God from the womb, and that he
        would deliver Israel out of the hands of the Philistines. When she told
        her husband about what the angel had said to her, her husband asked God
        to allow the angel to appear to him. The angel appeared, and said to
        him: "All that I commanded your wife let her observe." The woman
        conceived, and gave birth to Samson, and God blessed him and the Spirit
        of God filled him. At one time, he tore a lion apart as one would tear a
        young goat, and on another time, he killed thirty men and burned their
        fields. The Philistines rose against the tribe of Judah to fight and
        seize Samson, but Samson told the men of Judah: "Swear to me that you
        will not deliver me to them or kill me yourselves." They said to him:
        "No, but we will tie you securely and deliver you into their hands. We
        surely shall not kill you." They bound him with two new cords and
        brought him to the Philistines, who jumped upon him to kill him. The
        Spirit of the Lord came mightily upon him, and the strong cords that
        were on his arms became as flax that were burnt with fire, and his bonds
        broke loose off his hands. He found a fresh jaw-bone of an ass, reached
        out and took it with his hand and killed a thousand men with it. Then he
        became very thirsty, he cried out to the Lord and said: "You have given
        this great deliverance by the hands of you servant, and now shall I die
        from thirst... ?" The all mighty God then split a hollow place and water
        came out. He drank and his spirit returned, and he survived. When he was
        in Gaza, the Philistines surrounded the place and laid wait for him all
        the night at the gate of the city to capture and kill him. Samson arose
        at midnight, took hold of the doors of the gate, pulled them up, put
        them on his shoulders, and carried them to the top of the hill. The
        Philistines came to his wife, Delilah, and asked her to entice Samson to
        find out the secret of his strength. When Samson told her that the
        secret was in his hair, for he was a Nazirite Dedicated unto God). She
        told his enemies, lulled him to sleep on her knees, and called for a man
        to shave off the seven locks of hair off his head. She began to afflict
        him, as his strength went from him. The Philistines took him to their
        city, insulted him, and plucked out his eyes. His hair grew again, and
        his strength came back to him. He went to the temple of their idol, and
        took hold of the two middle pillars which supported the temple. Samson
        leaned with all his strength on the two pillars and said: "Let me die
        with the Philistines." The temple fell on three thousands of the
        Philistine people and their lords killing them all. So the dead that he
        killed on his death were more than he killed in his life. He judged for
        the people of Israel twenty years, then departed in peace. To our God is
        the glory for ever, Amen.'
      arabic: في هذا اليوم تذكار شمشون أحد قضاة بني اسرائيل وكان اسم والد هذا البار
        منوح من سبط دان وكانت أمه عاقرا فأتاها ملاك الرب وبشرها بميلاده وأمرها
        أن تتجنب النجاسات من الأطعمة وشرب المسكرات ما دامت حاملة به . وأن لا
        تحلق شعر رأسه لأنه يكون نذيرا لله . وعلي يديه يتم خلاص بني اسرائيل من
        أهل فلسطين فلما أخبرت بعلها بما كان سأل الله أن يريه الملاك فظهر له وقال
        " أوص امرأتك أن تحافظ علي تنفيذ ما قلته له " . فحبلت وولدت هذا الصديق
        وباركه الرب وحل فيه روح الله فوثب تارة علي أسد وشقه وتارة قتل من أهل
        فلسطين ثلاثين رجلا وأحرق زرعهم فقاموا علي بني يهوذا ليحاربوا ويعطوهم
        شمشون فأعلمه بنو يهوذا بالأمر فقال لهم " احلفوا أنتم أنكم لا تسلموني لهم
        ولا تقتلوني " ولما حلفوا له سلم ذاته فأوثقوه بسلسلتين وسلموه لأهل فلسطين
        فوثبوا عليه ليقتلوه . فحل عليه روح القوة من عند الرب القوي وقطع
        السلسلتين كخيط الكتان المحترق ثم وجد فك حمار فأخذه وحارب به فقتل ألفا من
        راكبي الخيل ولما عطش وأشرف علي الموت سأل الله تعالي أن يتجنن عليه وينبع
        له عين ماء عذب فشرب وتقوي ولما راقبوه وهو داخل غزة ليمسكوه قام في الليل
        وفك باب غزة وحمله علي كتفيه وسار حتى راس الجبل وبعد ذلك أرسلوا إلى زوجته
        ووعدوها بعطايا جزيلة لتستعلم منه عن سر قوته ولما أعلمها أن قوته في شعره
        لأنه نذير لله قامت وأعلمت أعداءه فكمنوا له ولما نام دخلوا عليه وحلقوا
        رأسه فضعفت قوته فقيدوه ومضوا به إلى بلادهم وأهانوه وقلعوا عينيه وبعد هذا
        نبت شعره ثانية وعادت إليه قوته فدخل إلى هيكل الوثن في يوم عيد الصنم وكان
        مجتمعا فيه جميع أهل غزة فوقف في وسط الهيكل وأحاط عمودا بيمينه وأخر
        بيساره ثم جمع يديه وقال " علي وعلي أعدائي " فسقط العمودان وسقط الهيكل
        بسقوطهما فمات كل من كان فيه وكان عدد الذين ماتوا في هذا الوقت أكثر من
        الذين قتلهم طول عمره ثم مات هو أيضا في جملتهم وكانت مدة حكمه في بني
        اسرائيل عشرين سنة ثم تنيح بسلام ولربنا المجد دائما آمين
