          english: 'On this day, the church celebrates the holy Patriarchs: Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Who can describe the virtues of he who became father to many nations? He believed in God, obeyed Him, and did not doubt His promises. The Lord appeared to him in a vision at night and told him, "Get out of your country, away from your family and from your father''s house, to a land that I will show you. I will make you a great nation; I will bless you and make your name great; and you shall be a blessing." (Genesis 12:1-2) Then the Lord appeared to Abraham in the form of three men. He welcomed them, for they were strangers, and God promised him the birth of Isaac. Abraham was then one hundred years old; Sarah, his wife, was advanced in age, and they believed the promise of God. When Isaac was born, Abraham, his father, circumcised him on the eighth day of his birth. Although he was sure that through his procreation all the nations of the earth would be blessed, God told him, "Take now your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and offer him there as a burnt offering." He did not doubt the promise of God. He began to offer his son as a sacrifice, confident that God would raise him, and raise offspring through him. When he fulfilled the sacrifice of Isaac by intention, God revealed his virtues to the generations to come by saying, "By Myself I have sworn, says the LORD, because you have done this thing, and have not withheld your son, your only son, in blessing I will bless you, and in multiplying I will multiply your descendants as the stars of the heaven." (Genesis 22:1-18) That was fulfilled and he was called the father of Christ in flesh. (Luke 3:34) He departed in peace when he was one hundred seventy-five years old. May his prayers be with us. Amen.'
          arabic: في هذا اليوم نعيد لآبائنا القديسين إبراهيم واسحق ويعقوب+ أما عن أبينا إبراهيم:فمن من البشر يستطيع أن يصف فضائله هذا الذي صار أبا لأمم كثيرة وآمن بالله وأطاع وصدق مواعيده ولم يشك فيها فقد ظهر له الرب في رؤيا الليل وقال له " اخرج من أرضك ومن بيت أبيك وتعال إلى الأرض التي بحاران " ثم ظهر له الرب في شبه ثلاثة رجال فظنهم أناسا عابرين فاستضافهم ، ووعده الله بولادة اسحق وكان حينئذ ابن مائة سنة وسارة زوجته تقدمت في أيامها فآمن الاثنان بقول الله . ولما ولد اسحق ختنه في اليوم الثامن لولادته . ومع أنه كان واثقا من أن بنسله تتبارك جميع أمم الأرض فقد قال له الله علي سبيل الامتحان:" خذ أبنك وحيدك الذي تحبه اسحق وقدمه لي محرقة " فلم يشك في قوله تعالي بل قدمه للذبح واثقا أن الله قادر أن يقيمه ويقيم به النسل . ولما أكمل ذبحه بالنية اظهر الله فضله للأجيال الآتية بقوله له:" بذاتي أقسمت يقول الرب:أني من أجل أنك فعلت هذا الأمر ولم تمسك أبنك وحيدك . أباركك مباركة وأكثر نسلك تكثيرا كنجوم السماء (تك 22:1 – 18 ) وقد تم له ذلك ، ودعي أبا للمسيح بالجسد (لو 3:34 ) وبعد أن بلغ مائة وخمسا وسبعين سنة انتقل بسلام . صلاته تكون معنا . آمين + أما أبونا اسحق فقد ولد بوعد الهي وكمل في البر والطاعة لله ولأبيه حتى رضي أن يذبحه قربانا لله وهو أبن الوعد الذي رزق به أبوه وعمره مائة سنة . ولم يكن اسحق صغيرا لأن الكتاب يقول:" أنه حمل الحطب مسافة بعيدة إلى أن صعد علي رأس الجبل " . ويقول بعض المؤرخين أن عمره وقتئذ كان يبلغ سبعا وثلاثين سنة ، فأطاع أباه ومد عنقه للذبح إلى أن أمر الملاك أباه برفع يده فكما دعي أبوه ذابح أبنه بالنية هكذا دعي هو أيضا ذبيحا بالنية وقد قاسي شدائد كثيرة وأحزان وتغرب ورزقه الله ولدين هما يعقوب وعيسو وكان اسحق يحب عيسو لشجاعته ولما شاخ وضعف بصره استدعي عيسو وقال له " أنا قد شخت يا ابني ولست أعرف يوم وفاتي . أذهب تصيد لي صيدا واصنع لي طعاما لآكل حتى تباركك نفسي " . وكانت رفقة تسمع هذا الكلام فاستدعت ابنها يعقوب وقالت له:" يا ابني اذبح صيدا وقدمه لأبيك ليأكل ويباركك قبل أن يموت " فقال يعقوب لأمه:" هوذا عيسو أخي رجل أشعر وأنا أملس ربما يجسني أبي فأكون في عينيه كمتهاون وأجلب علي نفسي لعنة لا بركة " قالت له أمه:" لعنتك علي يا ابني " وكان هذا منها بإيعاز الهي . فصنع يعقوب ما أمرته به وأكل أبوه وباركه (تك 27:1 – 29) ولما بلغ عمره مائة وثمانين سنة تنيح بسلام . صلاته تكون معنا . آمين + أما أب الأسباط يعقوب فقد دعاه الله إسرائيل كان أخوه عيسو يبغضه لأنه أخذ بركه أبيه ولهذا خاف منه ومضي إلى لابان خاله ورعي له غنمه سبع سنين فزوجه ابنته ليئة ثم رعي الغنم سبع سنين أخري فزوجه ابنته الثانية راحيل (تك 29:15 – 30) وكان إذا قال له خاله:" أن أجرتك كل الغنم الرقطاء ولدت الغنم رقطاء " وإذا قال له:" أن آجرتك كل الغنم المخططة ولدت الغنم مخططة " (تك 31:4 – 8) وقد أغناه الله جدا وعاد بامرأتيه ليئة وراحيل ورزقه الله اثني عشر أبنا ورأي الله وجها لوجه وصارعه حتى طلوع الفجر ودعاه الله إسرائيل وقد قاسي أحزانا وشدائد كثيرة مثل بيع ابنه يوسف كعبد للمصريين وفقده بصره وحدوث الغلاء الشديد وغير ذلك كما جاء بالكتاب المقدس ثم صار أبنه يوسف وزيرا لملك مصر وسعي حتى أحضره إليه فأقام بمصر سبع عشرة سنة ولما دنت أيام وفاته استدعي بنيه الأثنى عشر وباركهم وخص يهوذا بالملك وقال:أن السيد المسيح سيظهر من نسله وبعد ما بلغ عمره مائة وسبعا وأربعين سنة تنيح بسلام بعد أن أوصي أن يدفن في مقبرة آبائه وحمله يوسف علي مركبة فرعون وأتي به إلى أرض كنعان حيث دفن مع آبائه . صلواتهم تكون معنا ولربنا المجد دائما . آمين

          english: 2. Our father Isaac

          english: He was born by a divine promise, and he was perfect in piety and obedience to God and to his father. He was willing to be sacrificed by his father as an offering to God, although he was the son of the promise, and his father begot him when he was one hundred years old. Isaac was not a child then, for the Bible said, "So Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it on Isaac his son, and went to the place which was afar off." Some historians say that Isaac's age then was about thirty-seven years old. He obeyed his father, and laid down his neck for slaying, but the angel of the Lord ordered his father not to lay his hand on the lad. As it was considered that Abraham had fulfilled the sacrifice of his son by intention, it was also considered that Isaac was sacrificed by intention. He suffered many tribulations and sorrows. God gave him two sons, Esau and Jacob. Isaac loved Esau for his bravery. When Isaac was old and his eyes were so dim that he could not see, he called Esau, his older son, and said to him, "My son ... behold now, I am old. I do not know the day of my death. Now therefore, please ... go out to the field and hunt game for me. And make me savory food ... that I may eat, that my soul may bless you before I die." Rebekah was listening when Isaac spoke to Esau his son. She spoke to Jacob her son, saying, "... Go now to the flock and bring me from there two choice kids of the goats, and I will make savory food from them for your father, such as he loves ... that he may bless you before his death." Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, "Look, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth-skinned man. Perhaps my father will feel me, and I shall seem to be a deceiver to him; and I shall bring a curse on myself and not a blessing." But his mother said to him, "Let your curse be on me, my son." (Genesis 27:1-29) She did that by a divine inspiration. Jacob did as his mother ordered him, and his father ate and blessed him. Isaac departed in peace when he was one hundred eighty years old. May his prayers be with us. Amen.

          english: Esau, his brother, hated him for he took the blessing of their father from him. Jacob feared Esau, and fled to Laban, his uncle. He shepherded Laban's sheep for seven years and Laban gave Jacob his daughter, Leah, in marriage. Then Jacob served another seven years, and Laban gave him his second daughter, Rachel, in marriage. (Genesis 29:15-30) Then Laban, his uncle, told him, "The sheep that are streaked shall be your wages, then all the flocks bore streaked." (Genesis 31:4-8) God made him exceedingly wealthy. He returned with his two wives, Leah and Rachel, and God blessed him with twelve sons. He saw God face to face and wrestled with him until the breaking of day, and God called him Israel. He suffered many sorrows and tribulations, such as the selling of Joseph his son as a servant to the Egyptians, the loss of his sight, the severe famine, and others as mentioned in the Holy Bible. His son Joseph then rose to power and became the second man in Egypt after the Pharaoh, and he tried until he was able to bring his father Jacob to Egypt, where he stayed for seventeen years. When his departure drew near he called his twelve sons and blessed them. When he blessed Judah, he said, "The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh comes; and to Him shall be the obedience of the people." That was a prophesy about the coming of the Lord Christ from his seed. When he was one hundred forty-seven years, he departed in peace, after commanding that he be buried in the tomb of his fathers. Joseph carried him in the chariot of Pharaoh, brought him to the land of Canaan, where he was buried with his fathers. May his prayers be with us and Glory be to our God forever. Amen.
