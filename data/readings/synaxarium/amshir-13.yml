      english: On this day, St. Sergius, his father, his mother, his sister and many
        others with them, were martyred. This saint was born in the city of
        Atripe to a righteous father whose name was Theodore, and a faithful
        mother whose name was Mary. When he was 20 years old, St. Sergius
        desired to die for the Name of the Lord Christ. He presented himself to
        Cyprianus (Cyprian), the governor, and confessed his faith in the Lord
        Christ. The governor commanded him to be tortured with different kinds
        of tortures and to cast him in prison. At night he saw in a vision as if
        he was in heaven, and he saw the mansions of the saints. His soul was
        greatly comforted, and the Lord Christ healed him from his afflictions.
        A priest by the name of Mansoon heard about the labors of St. Sergius.
        Fr. Mansoon came with two deacons to Atripe and confessed the Name of
        the Lord Christ before the governor. The governor beat them with great
        cruelty. A multitude of people watched the tortures, and moved with
        compassion toward the priest, who could not do anything but to look at
        them, preach and command them to be steadfast in their faith in the Lord
        Christ. He prayed and blessed them and they all confessed the Orthodox
        faith. After they had been tortured, they were all beheaded, and
        received the crown of life. However, the Governor tortured the priest
        with fire, but the Lord saved him. The Governor sent him to Alexandria
        where he received his crown of martyrdom. As for St. Sergius, Governor
        Cyprianus brought him and tortured him with excruciating tortures but
        the Lord healed, strengthened and comforted him. They brought an idol
        and ordered him to worship it. He kicked the idol with his foot and it
        fell and broke. Cyprianus believed instantly and said, "The god that
        cannot save itself, cannot save others." The captain of the soldiers
        "Ohios" continued to torture St. Sergius, and ordered to skin him and to
        rub his wounds with salt and vinegar, but the Lord gave him strength and
        grace. His mother and his sister came to visit him and saw him in this
        condition, they wept bitterly, until his sister died from her extreme
        grief, but God raised her up by the prayers of the saint. St. Julius of
        Agfahs came, wrote the biography of St. Sergius, and promised him that
        he would take care of his body and his burial. The captain "Ohios"
        ordered that St. Sergius be tortured by pressing his body through the
        pressing wheel (Hinbazeen), that his nails be pulled out, that he be
        placed over an iron bed, with a fire under it, and that torches of fire
        be placed in his ears. The Lord strengthened him through all of this and
        healed him. When "Ohios" the captain was tired of torturing him, he
        decided to behead him. St. Sergius called his mother and sister to bid
        them farewell. They came with the rest of his family and when they saw
        him tied up with the bridle of a horse that was dragging him to the
        place of his martyrdom, they protested to the Governor for his extreme
        cruelty. He ordered to behead them all and they all received the crown
        of life and the eternal bliss. There was a young boy among the crowd
        whose eyes were opened by the Lord and he saw the souls of the saints
        who were martyred carried by the angels, ascending to heaven. He cried
        with a loud voice saying, "O My Lord Jesus Christ, have mercy upon me."
        His parents were afraid that the governor would hear him and destroy
        them because of him. When they could not calm him down, they put their
        hands upon his mouth to prevent him from screaming, asking the help of
        the Lord Christ, until he gave up his pure soul at the hand of the Lord.
        Their prayers be with us all. Amen.

      english: On this day also of the year 528 A.D., the holy father Abba Timothy
        III, 32nd Pope of Alexandria, departed. His enthronement on the
        apostolic throne was in 511 A.D. He suffered many hardships because he
        was steadfast in the Orthodox faith. In his days, St. Severus, Patriarch
        of Antioch, came to Egypt escaping persecution. The two saints traveled
        together to Egyptian cities and monasteries confirming the people in the
        Orthodox faith. Because he did not agree with Emperor Marcion with
        regard to the canons of the Council of Chalcedon, he was exiled. On the
        day of his exile, the faithful opposed the enforcement of the order of
        his exile, and many of them were killed, about two hundred thousand, by
        the order of the Emperor. The saint departed in exile together with St.
        Severus of Antioch, after he had been on the apostolic throne for 17
        years. His prayers be with us and Glory be to our God forever. Amen.
