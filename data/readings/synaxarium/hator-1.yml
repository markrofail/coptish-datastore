      english: On this day, the striver Saints Maximus, Numitius, Victor (Boctor), and
        Philip (Philopus) were martyred. They lived in the days of Decius the
        Emperor. During his reign, the seven young men disappeared in a cave in
        a mountain in Ephesus. These four saints were from Africa, and they were
        brethren in spiritual love. The desire for Christ gathered them
        together. When Emperor Decius was torturing the Christians, they agreed
        together to declare their faith. They went before the Prefect and
        confessed that they were Christians and only worshipped and bowed to
        Christ. He ordered them beaten, and they were many times, with whips and
        sticks. Their backs were burned with red-hot rods. Their bodies then
        were rubbed with rags made of hair steeped in vinegar and salt. In spite
        of all this severe torture they remained steadfast in the faith. Some of
        the people present believed in the Lord Christ when they saw their
        patience and endurance. Finally, the Prefect ordered the heads of some
        of the saints to be cut off and the sword to be used on the others. Thus
        they all received the crown of martyrdom. Their prayers be with us.
        Amen. 2. The Commemoration of Saint Cleopas the Apostle and His
        Companion. On this day also is the commemoration of St. Cleopas the
        Apostle and his companion who were traveling to a village called Emmaus.
        So it was, while they conversed and reasoned, that Jesus Himself drew
        near, and went with them. When they did not know Him, He said to them,
        "O foolish ones, and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets
        have spoken! Ought not the Christ to have suffered these things and to
        enter into His glory?" Later, as He sat at the table with them, He took
        bread, blessed, and broke it, and gave it to them. Then, their eyes were
        opened, and they knew Him, and He vanished from their sight. (Luke
        24:13-31) These two Apostles were among the 72 Apostles. Their prayers
        be with us and Glory be to our God, forever. Amen

      arabic: في مثل هذا اليوم استشهد القديسون المجاهدون مكسيموس ونوميتيوس وبقطر
        وفيلبس . وكانوا في ايام دقلديانوس الملك ، الذي في عهده اختفي الفتية
        السبعة في كهف بجبل في أفسس . وكان هؤلاء القديسون من أفريقية ، وقد تآخوا
        بالحب الروحاني ، وجمعهم الشوق إلى المسيح عندما كان هذا الملك يعذب
        المسيحيين ، واتفق رأيهم إن يظهروا إيمانهم . فتقدموا إلى الأمير واقروا
        انهم مسيحيون . وأنهم للمسيح يسجدون ويعبدون . فأمر بضربهم فضربوا مرارا
        بالسياط وبالعصي ، ثم احرق ظهورهم بسفافيد محماة . ثم دلكوا أجسادهم بخرق
        من شعر مبللة بالخل والملح . وإذ لم ينثنوا عن رأيهم بالرغم من هذا العذاب
        الشديد ، بل آمن بعض الحاضرين بالسيد المسيح عندما رأوا صبرهم وثباتهم ،
        فأمر الملك حينئذ بضرب رقاب بعض القديسين ، وإن يعمل السيف في البعض الآخر
        . فنالوا بذلك إكليل الشهادة . صلاتهم تكون معنا امين .

      arabic: في مثل هذا اليوم تذكار القديسين كليوباس الرسول ورفيقه ، اللذين كانا
        منطلقين إلى قرية عمواس . وفيما هما يتكلمان ويتحاوران اقترب منهما الرب
        يسوع نفسه ، ولما لم يعرفاه . قال لهما "أيها الغبيان والبطيئا القلوب في
        الإيمان بجميع ما تكلم به الأنبياء أما كان ينبغي إن المسيح يتألم بهذا
        ويدخل إلى مجده" ، ولما اتكأ معهما اخذ خبزا وبارك وكسر وناولهما . فانفتحت
        أتعينهما وعرفاه ثم اختفي عنهما . وهذان الرسولان من الاثنين والسبعين
        رسولا . صلاتهما تكون معنا . امين .
