      english: On this day the church celebrates the appearance of the body of St.
        Apolidus (Hippolytus), Pope of Rome. He was a virtuous and a perfect man
        in his generation. He was chosen to the Roman See after Father Augius.
        This was in the first year of the enthronement of Abba Cladianus, 9th
        Pope of Alexandria. Pope Apolidus was always teaching his people and
        guarding them from the pagan influences, confirming them in the faith of
        the Lord Christ. When reports of St. Apolidus reached the infidel
        Emperor Claudius Caesar, he arrested him and tortured him severely. The
        Emperor then tied his feet with a heavy stone, and cast him in the sea
        on the 5th day of Amshir. On the following day, one of the faithful
        found the body of the saint floating above the water, and the stone was
        bound to his feet. The man took it to his home and shrouded the body.
        The news spread in the City of Rome and in all the neighboring cities,
        and it reached Caesar, who asked for the body, but the man hid it. This
        father left a great wealth of teachings about the Incarnation, and
        several sermons about Christian teaching. He also established 38 bylaws.
        His prayers be with us all. Amen.
      arabic: في مثل هذا اليوم استشهد القديسون اباكير ويوحنا والثلاث عذارى، ثاؤذورا
        التي تفسيرها عطية الله ، وثاؤبستي التي تفسيرها أمانة الله ، وثاؤذكسيا
        التي تفسيرها مجد الله . وأمهن أثناسيا التي تفسيرها غير المائتة. وذلك إن
        القديس اباكير كان راهبا متعبدا منذ حداثته وكان القديس يوحنا جنديا من
        خاصة الملك . وقد تركا الإسكندرية وطنهما الأصلي وأقاما في إنطاكية . ولما
        أثار الملك دقلديانوس الاضطهاد علي المسيحيين ، اعترفا مع العذارى وأمهن
        أمامه بالسيد المسيح. وإذ عرف انهم من الإسكندرية أمر بإعادتهم إليها .
        فلما وصلوا إلى هناك قدموهم إلى الوالي فاعترفوا بالسيد المسيح فأمر بقطع
        رؤوسهم . وكانت القديسة أثناسيا تثبت بناتها وتصبرهن وتعرفهن بانهن اذا
        استشهدن يصرن عرائس المسيح . وهكذا قطعوا رؤوسهن اولا ثم امهن فالقديسين
        اباكير ويوحنا . وبعد ذلك طرحوا أجسادهم للوحوش وطيور السماء . ولكن بعض
        المؤمنين أتوا واخذوا الأجساد ليلا ووضعوها في تابوت . صلاتهم تكون معنا
        ولربنا المجد دائما أبديا آمين.

      english: 2. The Martyrdom of the Saints Abakir, John, the Three Virgins and
        Their Mother.
      arabic: 2. نياحة البابا مرقس الرابع

      english: On this day also, the saints Abakir; John; the three virgins, Theodora
        (which means the gift of God), Theopisti "Theophana" (which means the
        faithfulness of God), and Theodosia (which means the glory of God); and
        their mother, Athanasia (which means the immortal), were martyred. St.
        Abakir was a monk since his young age, and St. John was a soldier in the
        private guards of the Emperor. They left Alexandria, their own home
        town, and lived in Antioch. When Diocletian incited the persecution
        against the Christians, they confessed their faith in the Lord Christ
        along with the virgins and their mother. When the Emperor knew that they
        were from Alexandria, he returned them to the governor of Alexandria.
        When they came to Alexandria, and were brought before the Governor, they
        confessed their faith in the Lord Christ. He ordered them beheaded. St.
        Athanasia was comforting and confirming her daughters and telling them
        that if they were martyred, they would become the brides of Christ. The
        virgins were beheaded first, then their mother, then St. Abakir and St.
        John. Their bodies were cast to the wild beasts and to the birds of the
        sky. However, some believers came and took their bodies by night and
        they placed them in a coffin and hid them until the end of the time of
        persecution. Their prayers be with us, and Glory be to our God forever.
        Amen.
