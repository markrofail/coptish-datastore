      arabic: 1. نياحة ميخا النبى
    text:
      english: On this day, the great righteous prophet Micah, departed. He prophesied
        about Samaria and Jerusalem during the time of Jotham, Ahaz and Hezkiah,
        kings of Judeah. He prophesied about the incarnation of the Lord, to
        Whom is the Glory, saying, "For behold, the Lord is coming out of His
        high place. He will come down and tread on the high places of the
        earth." (Micah 1:3) He prophesied about His birth in Bethlehem, saying,
        "But you Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are little among the thousands
        of Judah, yet out of you shall come forth to Me. The one to be ruler in
        Israel. Whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting."
        (Micah 5:2) He prophesied about the futility of the Jewish temple and
        the going forth of the Law of the Gospel from Zion, saying, " ... For
        out of Zion the Law shall go forth, and the word of the Lord from
        Jerusalem." (Micah 4:2) He also prophesied about the perdition of Ahab,
        king of Israel. (Micah 5:15,16) When this prophet finished his strife in
        peace, he departed at a good old age. He preceded the Lord Christ by
        about eight hundred years. May his prayers be with us. Amen.
