      english: 1. The Departure of the Righteous Joachim, The Lord Christ Grandfather.
      arabic: 1. نياحة يواقيم البار والد العذراء أم الاله
    text:
      english: On this day the righteous Joachim (Yonakhir - Zadok) departed. He was
        the father of St. Mary, the Theotokos, the mother of God incarnate. He
        was of the seed of David, and of the tribe of Judah, for he was the son
        of Jotham, the son of Lazarus, the son of Eldad who ascended up in
        genealogy to Solomon the king, the son of David whom God promised that
        his seed should reign over the children of Israel for ever. The wife of
        this righteous man, Hannah was barren, and both of them prayed and
        entreated God continually to give them a child. Having accepted their
        petition He gave them a good and sweet fruit, which satisfied all the
        men of the world, and removed from them the bitterness of servitude, and
        He made Joachim worthy to be called the father of the Lord Christ in
        regard of His marvelous and wondrous Incarnation. After God had pleased
        him with the birth of our Lady, his heart was rejoiced and he offered
        his offerings, and the shame had been removed from him, he departed in
        peace when the Virgin was three years old. May his prayers be with us.
        Amen.
      arabic: في مثل اليوم تنيح الصديق يواقيم (سمي أيضا بوناخير وصادوق ) والد السيدة
        العذراء والدة الإله بالجسد . وهذا كان من نسل داود من سبط يهوذا وهو ابن
        يوثام بن لعازر بن اليود الذي يصعد في النسب إلى سليمان بن داود الذي وعده
        الله أن نسله يملك علي بني إسرائيل إلى الأبد . هذا الصديق كانت زوجته
        عاقرا وبمداومته معها علي السؤال والطلبة من الله رزقهما ثمرة صالحة حلوة
        أشبعت كل أهل العالم ونزعت من أفواههم مرارة العبودية ولهذا استحق أن يدعي
        أبا للسيد المسيح من حيث التجسد العجيب الغريب . وبعد أن أقر الله عينيه
        بمولد السيدة وفرح قلبه قدم قربانه وزال عنه العار . وتنيح بسلام حيث كانت
        العذراء ابنة ثلاث سنين . صلاته تكون معنا . آمين

      english: 2. The Departure of St. Macrobius.
      arabic: 2. نياحة القديس مقرفيوس
    text:
      english: On this day also the saint Anba Macrobius, the son of the governor of
        the city of Kaw, departed in peace. When Anba Severus, Archbishop of
        Antioch, was wondering around the cities of Upper Egypt, he came to the
        city of Kaw and Macrobius ministered unto him. He accompanied Anba
        Severus in his visit to the monastery of Anba Moses, where he saw from
        the holiness of the monks, their asceticism and devoutness, made him ask
        Anba Moses to accept him as a monk. Anba Moses indicated to him the
        hardship of the monastic life and its difficulties especially he was
        raised in luxury and family wealth, and the one that slept on silk,
        could not take the rough life. When Anba Moses saw the insistence of
        Macrobius on the monastic life he asked him first to resign his job that
        he took after his father, and to relinquish all his money and
        possessions. He went to his city Kaw, appointed his brother in his
        place, returned and put on the monastic garb. When his brothers Paul,
        Ilias, and Joseph saw what their brother had done, they came to him and
        became monks by the hands of Anba Moses. Anba Macrobius built many
        monasteries and many monks, about a thousand gathered around him, and he
        also built convents for about a thousand nuns. He used his money to
        build many places for those that did not desire the monastic life, and
        he supported those who sought his help. Then he sent to Anba Moses
        asking to send him brethren to prepare those gathered around him for the
        monastic life, they came and put on them the monastic garb. Christians
        from the cities of Assuit, Shatb, and neighboring cities came and gave
        him many gifts and much money to help him in building the churches and
        monasteries. He accepted it from them and blessed them. Anba Macrobius
        increased in virtues, asceticism and giving alms to the weak, needy,
        widows, orphans and the lonely, beside caring for his monasteries. His
        alms were from his own money not from that was offered. God granted St.
        Macrobius the gift of healing, they brought him the sick and he healed
        them with the power of God and the strength of their faith. The father
        the Patriarch Anba Theodosius, heard about him and he wrote to him
        praising and encouraging him to be steadfast in virtue, asceticism and
        loving the strangers and asked him to come for the people of Alexandria
        to be blessed by him. When he came to the Patriarch, he rejoiced with
        him and called the people of Alexandria to receive the blessing from
        him, and he ordained him a priest. Macrobius returned to his monastery,
        the people of Assuit and Shatb received him with songs and hymns until
        they came to the monastery. Many miracles were performed through his
        hands, and when he finished his good strife, he departed in peace.
        Multitudes gathered from Assuit, Shatb, Abu-Sergah, Kaw and the
        neighboring cities, and his brother Anba Yousab, who was appointed as
        his successor in running the monasteries in the fear of God, prayed and
        buried him. The appearance of his body was on the seventh day of the
        blessed month of Tubah, seven hundred thirty three years after his
        departure by the hands of the deacon Los El-Talawy the servant of his
        monastery's church, during the days of Anba Yousab, bishop of Akhmeem
        and the notable Isaac the scribe of the prince Eiz-Eldeen El-Hamawy.
        Anba Yousab, bishop of Akhmeem, took the body out of its tomb in the
        mountain, down to the church of the monastery, where they buried him
        with hymns and praises. May his prayers be with us. Amen.
