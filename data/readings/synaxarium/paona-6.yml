          english: On this day, of the year 1658 A.M. (1942 A.D.) Pope Yoannis the
              Nineteenth, 113th Patriarch of Alexandria, departed. He was born in the
              village of Dair Tasa, Asyiut governorate in the year 1571 A.M. (1855
              A.D.). His parents were righteous, therefore he was raised on piety and
              godliness. He drank the love of virtuous life and loved, since his young
              age, to read the biographies of saints. He longed to follow their
              example, accordingly he went to the monastery of the Virgin Lady known
              as El-Baramous in Wadi El-Natroun, in the month of Baramoudah, 1591 A.M.
              He became a monk on the third of Kiahk, 1592 A.M. (1876 A.D.). Because
              of his fervent worship, intelligence, and intellect, the fathers
              unanimously agreed to nominate him to be a priest. Pope Kyrillos the
              fifth, 112th Patriarch, ordained him a priest in the year 1593 A.M.,
              then hegumen in Baramhat, 1594 A.M., and appointed him on the same day
              to be the head of the monastery. He remained the head of the monastery
              for ten years, during which he was an example of, ambition, honesty,
              purity of conduct, firmness, godliness, and good management. When the
              Chair of the diocese of El-Biharah became vacant, the people chose
              Yoannis a metropolitan for that Chair. He was ordained on the 12th day
              of Baramhat, 163 A.M. (1887 A.D.) and also was appointed as a deputy of
              the See of St. Mark. After the departure of Anba Yoannis, metropolitan
              of El-Menofaya at that time, the people of the diocese nominated him to
              care for them. The diocese of El-Menofaya was added to his duties in the
              year 1610 A.M. (1894 A.D.), and he became the metropolitan of
              El-Biharah, El-Menofaya, and the deputy of the See of St. Mark. Since
              his official seat was in Alexandria, he established there a theological
              school to educate the monks. He sent from its students a mission to
              Athens for higher theological studies. The revenue of the church
              properties was inconsiderable. By his good judgement, the revenue
              increased year after year. Because of the highrise buildings that he
              built and the renovation of the old ones. He also gave great care for
              the Coptic schools, elementary and high, until their standard became
              equivalent to the best schools. He built and renovated most of the
              churches in his parish. He also gave special attention to the
              monasteries in his jurisdiction, which were improved greatly because of
              his good care and close supervision. Because of his foresight, and
              prudence, the government chose him as a representative for the Copts in
              many councils and committees at the general assembly, the committee for
              formulating the constitution and many others. He spent forty-two years
              as a metropolitan, which were full of splendid works. When the blessed
              Pope Kyrillos the fifth, departed, on the 1st day of Misra, 1643 A.M.
              (August 7th, 1927 A.D.) the Holy Synod convened on the fourth of Misra.
              They unanimously agreed to chose him Acting Pope to run the affairs of
              the church until ordaining a patriarch. As a result of that, the Holy
              Synod had received many nominations from the parishes approving that
              choice. He performed his duties as Acting Patriarch for one year, four
              months, and ten days. During this period he administered the affairs of
              the See of St. Mark very well, during which also the Holy Synod, with
              Anba Yoannis presiding, issued a canon to regulate the affairs of the
              monasteries and the monks. He organized a committee to oversee the
              church properties and those of the monasteries and to review their
              accounts. From what everyone knew of his purity, virtuous life, good
              character, asceticism, and piety, they all unanimously agreed to chose
              him a patriarch with nominations from the bishops, priests and lay
              leaders. He was enthroned a patriarch on Sunday the 7th day of Kiahk
              1645 A.M. (December 16th, 1928 A.D.) in the great St. Mark cathedral in
              Cairo (Azbakiah). That took place with a great celebration attended by
              the representatives of the King, princes, ministers, important Egyptian
              personalities, the metropolitans of different denominations eastern and
              western, and ambassadors of foreign countries. After his ordination,
              Pope Yoannis directed his attention to caring for the affairs of the
              Coptic People and the church. He established a higher theological
              institution for the education of the monks in the city of Helwan. He
              ordained for the kingdom of Ethiopia, a Coptic Metropolitan and four
              well-learned Ethiopian bishops. He travelled to Ethiopia to reaffirm the
              unity between the Coptic and Ethiopian churches. He stayed there for
              thirteen days where they received him with great honor and respect. In
              Addis Ababa, he ordained the head of the Ethiopian monks (the successor
              of St. Takla Haymanot) a bishop. With the will of God, he made the Holy
              Oil (Myron) in the year 1648 A.M. (1930 A.D.). The last time the oil was
              made was one hundred and ten years earlier during the papacy of Pope
              Peter, 19th Pope of Alexandria. Pope Yoannis made the Holy Oil a second
              time, specially for the kingdom of Ethiopia, attended by Anba Kyrillos,
              metropolitan of Ethiopia, and Anba Peter, an Ethiopian bishop. His
              contributions, too numerous to be mentioned completely, include watching
              over the welfare of the church, kindness to the needy, support for
              charitable organizations, moral and financial support for the Coptic
              teaching institutions, and assistance on valuable projects that
              financially and spiritually benefitted the Copts. During Pope Yoannis'
              papacy, a war broke out between Ethiopia and Italy, during which most of
              the Ethiopian bishops died except Anba Abraam and another bishop. When
              Italy occupied Ethiopia, the Emperor departed from his country. Anba
              Kyrillos, the metropolitan of Ethiopia, was exiled to Egypt, for he
              refused to agree with Italy on separating the Ethiopian church from the
              Coptic Orthodox church. In November, 1937 A.D., the Italian governor of
              Ethiopia decided the independence of the Ethiopian church and its
              separation from the Alexandrian See. He appointed Anba Abraam, the
              Ethiopian bishop, a patriarch for Ethiopia. Nevertheless, God punished
              him for his betrayal. He became blind and died shortly after. The
              Alexandrian Holy Synod decided to excommunicate him, not recognizing him
              nor the bishops that he ordained. This situation in Ethiopia did not
              last long; during the Second World War the Emperor of Ethiopia regained
              his kingdom from Italy. Anba Kyrillos returned to his church with great
              honor, in May 1942 A.D. When Pope Yoannis had realized the return of the
              Ethiopian church to its mother church, the Coptic Church, he was
              stricken with the ailments of old age. He departed in peace on Sunday
              14th day of Baounah, 1658 A.M. (June 21st, 1942 A.D.). May his prayers
              be with us. Amen

          english: On this day also, Sts. Apakir, John, Ptolemy and Philip, were martyred.
              St. Apakir was born in the city of Damanhur, and had a rich brother
              called Philip. They had agreed with two priests, one called John and the
              other called Ptolemy, to receive the crown of martyrdom. They went to
              the city of Kartsa (Kartes), and confessed the name of the Lord Christ
              before the Governor. The governor ordered to shoot them to death with
              arrows, but the arrows did not touch them. They were then cast into red
              hot fire, but the angel of the lord delivered them from it. Then the
              governor commanded to tie them to the tails of horses, and to drag them
              from Kartes to the city of Damanhur, but the Lord guarded them from any
              harm. The governor commanded that their heads be cut off outside the
              city of Damanhur. They received the crown of martyrdom. People from the
              city of Sa came and took the body of St. Apakir, built for him a church,
              and laid his body inside it. Many signs and wonders took place through
              him. The people of Damanhur came and took the bodies of John, Ptolemy,
              and Philip, wrapped them in expensive shrouds and buried them there. May
              their prayers be with us and Glory be to God forever. Amen.
