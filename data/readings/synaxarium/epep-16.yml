          english: 1. The Departure of St. John, of the Golden Gospel.
          arabic: 1. نياحة القديس يوحنا صاحب الانجيل الذهبى

          english: On this day, St. John, the owner of the Golden Gospel, departed. This saint was born in the city of Rome. His father was a rich man whose name was Atrofius (Trabius). His father gave him a copy of the Gospel of St. John written in letters of gold and bound with a golden cover and from this he was generally known as "John of the Golden Gospel." John rejoiced exceedingly with this gift. A monk, who was on his way to Jerusalem, came to visit his father's house. John asked the monk to take him with him. The monk told him that he was going to Jerusalem and not to the monastery. He also told him that he was young and could not endure the rough life that the monks practiced. Nevertheless, John was sincere in his intention, so he embarked on a ship, without telling anyone, to the monastery of that monk. When the Abbot saw him, he refused to accept him because of his young age, and explained to him that the monastic life was difficult for one like him. John pleaded with him, and when the Abbot saw his firm intention and strong conviction, he accepted him. He shaved his head, and arrayed him in the holy garb of the monastic life. John devoted himself to the ascetic life with many worships. The Abbot often advised him saying, "Have pity on yourself, and do as the rest of the brethren." But John used to answer, saying, "The power of God and your prayers support me." Seven years later, he saw in a vision, who told him, "Rise, and go to your parents, that you might receive their blessings before your departure from this world." This vision was repeated on three consecutive nights, and he told the Abbot about it. The Abbot told him that this was from God, and advised him to go to see his parents. When he left the monastery, he found a poor man wearing ragged garments, he took them from him, and gave him his own monk's garb. When he arrived at his father's house, he lived for three years, near the door of the house, in a small hut made of straw. He ate, during this time, the fragments from his father's table which the servants threw to him. Whenever his mother passed by him, she was disgusted by his smell and the appearance of his clothes. When his departure drew near, the Lord made it known to him that after three days he would depart from this world. St. John sent and called his mother. Without telling her that he was her son, he made her swear to bury him in that hut with whatever clothes he had on. Then, he gave her the golden Gospel and said to her, "Whenever you read in it, remember me." When his father returned to the house, she showed him the Gospel, and immediately he recognized that it was the Gospel of his son John. They came in haste to St. John and asked him about the Gospel and about their son. He asked them to assure him that they would not bury him except in the clothes that he had on, and then he told them that he was their son. They wept with a great weeping. When the nobles of the city of Rome heard that, they gathered to see this righteous monk. After three days, he departed and his mother clothed him with the clothes that she had prepared for his wedding day before he went to the monastery. Thereupon she fell sick, and her husband remembered the oath that they had given. Immediately he removed the clothes of his son and clothed him with the old ragged cloth that he had on and buried him in the hut in which he had lived. Many miracles were manifested from his body. Then they built a church in his name and placed his body in it. May his prayers with us. Amen.
          arabic: في مثل هذا اليوم تنيح القديس يوحنا صاحب الإنجيل الذهب . ولد هذا القديس بمدينة رومية من أب غني يسمي اطروفيوس (أو اطرافيموس ) . ولما كان يوحنا يتلقي العلم في المكتب طلب من أبيه أن يجلد له الإنجيل الذي كان يقرأ فيه بالذهب فعمل له ما أراد ففرح به كثيرا واتفق أن أحد الرهبان نزل عندهم عند ذهابه إلى بيت المقدس فطلب منه يوحنا أن يأخذه معه . فأعلمه أنه ذاهب إلى القدس وليس إلى الدير . ثم عرفه أنه صغير السن ، ولا يحتمل عيشة التقشف التي يمارسها الرهبان ، غير أن يوحنا كان صادقا في عزمه فسافر وحده في سفينة إلى دير ذلك الراهب ولما رآه الرئيس لم يرد أن يقبله لصغر سنه ، وأفهمه أن العيشة الرهبانية شاقة علي مثله ولما ألح عليه يوحنا ورأي فيه الرئيس ثبات العزم وقوة اليقين حلق له شعر رأسه وألبسه ثوب الرهبنة المقدس فأجهد يوحنا نفسه بعبادات زائدة وكان الأب الرئيس ينصحه قائلا:" ترفق بنفسك وسر مثل سائر الأخوة " فكان يقول له " ان قوة الله وصلاتك عني تعينني " وبعد سبع سنوات رأي في رؤيا من يقول له:" قم أذهب إلى والديك لتأخذ بركتهما قبل انتقالك من هذا العالم " وتكررت هذه الرؤيا ثلاث ليال متوالية فأعلم الرئيس بها ، فعرفه أن هذا من الله وأشار عليه بالذهاب فلما خرج من الدير وجد رجلا مسكينا عليه ثياب رثة ، فأخذها منه وأعطاه ثيابه . ولما وصل منزل والديه قضي ثلاث سنوات قريبا من باب البيت يقيم في عشة من القش وكان يقتات أثناءها من فضلات موائد أبيه التي يرميها الخدم , وكانت أمه إذا عبرت به تشمئز نفسها من رائحته ومن منظر ثيابه الرثة . . ولما دنت نياحته أعلمه الرب أنه بعد ثلاثة أيام سينتقل من هذا العالم فاستدعي والدته ولم يعرفها بنفسه واستحلفها أن تدفنه في العشة التي يقيم فيها بما عليه من الثياب ثم أعطاها الإنجيل الذهب قائلا:كلما قرأت فيه تذكرينني فلما حضر والده إلى المنزل أرته الإنجيل فعرف أنه إنجيل ولده يوحنا فأسرع إليه الاثنان وسألاه عن الإنجيل وعن ولدهما فطلب منهما أن يتعهدا بأن لا يدفناه إلا في ثيابه التي عليه . ثم عرفهما بأنه ولدهما . ثم خرجت روحه إلي خالقه ، فبكيا بكاء عظيما وسمع بذلك أكابر روميه ، فكفنته أمه بالثياب التي أعدتها ليوم زواجه قبل ذهابه إلى الدير فمرضت لوقتها فتذكر زوجها التعهد الذي قطعاه وفي الحال نزع عن ابنه هذه الثياب وألبسه ثيابه القديمة ودفنه في العشة التي كان بها وحصلت من جسده عجائب كثيرة ثم بنوا له كنيسة علي اسمه ووضعوا جسده بها . صلاته تكون معنا . آمين

      text:
          english: On this day also, was the arrival of the holy relics of St. George, the great martyr, to his church in Old Cairo. A monk called Fr. Marcus, who was the hegumen and Abbot of El-Qualamoun monastery, used to visit the villages and the cities every year to visit the Christians. One night, while he was visiting someone in one of the villages he used to visit, he saw St. George (Gawargios) in a vision, who told him, "Take my body from the woman that will be coming to you tomorrow, and place it in my church that is in Old Cairo." On the next day, a woman came to him and told him that she had a box that her father had brought before his death from the church of St. George in Palestine. This fulfilled the vision, and he went with her and examined the box. Then, he went to Pope Gabrial, 88th Pope, and told him about the vision and the box. Immediately the Pope rose up and took with him the priests and the deacons, and went to where the box was. After they took the blessings of the holy relics and gave some money to the woman, they carried the box in a venerable celebration. They brought it to the church of St. George in Old Cairo where many signs were manifested from it. May his prayers be with us and Glory be to God forever. Amen.
