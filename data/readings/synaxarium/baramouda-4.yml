      english: 'On this day the holy father Anba Isaac the Disciple of the great
        father Anba Apollo, departed. This holy man renounced the world since
        his young age. He became a monk in the wilderness of Sheahat (Scetis),
        and a disciple of Anba Apollo for twenty five years. He fought a
        strenuous fight that weakened his body to kill his body desires, and
        control his will. He mastered the virtue of silence and quietness
        especially during the prayers and the Liturgies. He used to stand during
        the liturgy with his hands clasped and his head bent until the end of
        the prayer then he returned to his cell, shutting his door, and did not
        associate with any one that day. When they asked him: "Why do you not
        talk to anyone who wish to talk to you during prayers or the Liturgy?"
        He answered saying: "There is time for talking and there is time for
        praying." When his departure drew near the fathers the monks gathered
        around him to receive his blessing and they asked him: "Why did you flee
        from men." He answered them: "I was not fleeing from men but from Satan.
        If a man hold a lighted lamp in the wind, it will be extinguished. So,
        it is with us when our hearts and minds shine because of the prayers and
        the Liturgy then we talk with each other, our hearts and minds become
        dark." And this holy father having finished his good spiritual strife,
        departed in peace. May his prayers be with us. Amen.'
      arabic: في مثل هذا اليوم استشهد القديسون . بقطر وداكيوس وايريني العذراء ومن معهم
        من رجال ونساء وعذارى . وذلك أنهم كانوا في زمان تملك الملك قسطنطين الكبير
        وابنه ، اللذين هدما معابد كثيرة للوثنيين ثم حولاها إلى كنائس علي اسم
        السيدة العذراء وأسماء القديسين . ولما ملك يوليانوس الكافر عضد عبادة
        الأوثان وأحسن كهنتها وقتل عددا عظيما من المسيحيين ورفع إليه بعضهم خبر
        هؤلاء القديسين وما أجروه بالبرابي والأصنام فقبض عليهم وعذبهم بأنواع
        العذاب وأخيرا قطع رؤوسهم فنالوا إكليل الشهادة صلاتهم تكون معنا . ولربنا
        المجد دائما آمين

      english: 'On this day also of the year 861 A.M. (April 5th., 1145 A.D.) the
        great and holy father Pope Gabriel II, the seventy Pope of the See of
        St. Mark, who was known as Ibn Turaik, departed. This Pope was from the
        nobles of Cairo, and he was a writer, scribe, distinguished scholar,
        with a commendable conduct. He transcribed with his hand many Arabic and
        Coptic books, he retained its contents and comprehended its
        interpretations. The elders of the people and the clergy chose him for
        the Patriarchal Chair, and his enthronement was on the 9th day of
        Amshir, 847 A.M. (February 3rd., 1131 A.D.). When he prayed his first
        Divine Liturgy in St. Macarius monastery as the custom of the previous
        Patriarchs, at the end of the Liturgy, he added to the profession after
        the saying: "I believe and confess to the last breath, that this is the
        life-giving Flesh that Thine Only-Begotten Son, our Lord, God and
        Savior, Jesus Christ, took from our Lady, the Lady of us all, the holy
        Mother of God, Saint Mary," this sentence "He made it one with His
        Divinity." The monks objected, lest it would be understood from that
        there was mingling between His Divinity and His Humanity, and asked him
        to refrain from using it. He refused saying: "This statement was added
        by a decree from the council of bishops." After a great and lengthy
        discussion, they decided to add this sentence: "Without mingling,
        without confusion, and without alteration," because of the fear of
        falling in the heresy of Eutyches, and he agreed with them. During his
        papacy, he ordained 53 bishops and many priests, he drew up Canons and
        laws concerning inheritance, and many other matters. He never took any
        money from anyone, nor he touched the revenue of the churches, or that
        of the religious endowments for the poor. When the governor of that time
        asked him for money, the nobles and people collected three hundred
        Dinars in gold and gave them to the governor on his behalf. He remained
        on the Episcopal Chair for fourteen years, two month and two days, then
        departed in peace. May his prayers be with us and glory be to God
        forever. Amen.'
