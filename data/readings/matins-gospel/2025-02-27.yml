    english: But as they sailed He fell asleep. And a windstorm came down on the lake, and they were filling with water, and were in jeopardy. And they came to Him and awoke Him, saying, "Master, Master, we are perishing!" Then He arose and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water. And they ceased, and there was a calm. But He said to them, "Where is your faith?" And they were afraid, and marveled, saying to one another, "Who can this be? For He commands even the winds and water, and they obey Him!"
    arabic: 'وفيما هم سائرون نام فنزل نوء ريحٍ في البحيرة وكانوا يمتلئون ماءً وصاروا في خطرٍ فتقدموا وأيقظوه قائلين: يا معلم يا معلم إننا نهلك فقام وانتهر الريح وتموج الماء فانتهيا وصار هدوءٌ ثم قال لهم: أين إيمانكم فخافوا وتعجبوا قائلين فيما بينهم: من هو هذا فإنه يأمر الرياح أيضاً والماء فتطيعه'
