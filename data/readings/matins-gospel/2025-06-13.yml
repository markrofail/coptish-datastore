    english: Soon afterward, Jesus went to a town called Nain, and his disciples and a large crowd went along with him. As he approached the town gate, a dead person was being carried out--the only son of his mother, and she was a widow. And a large crowd from the town was with her. When the Lord saw her, his heart went out to her and he said, "Don't cry." Then he went up and touched the coffin, and those carrying it stood still. He said, "Young man, I say to you, get up!" The dead man sat up and began to talk, and Jesus gave him back to his mother. They were all filled with awe and praised God. "A great prophet has appeared among us," they said. "God has come to help his people." This news about Jesus spread throughout Judea and the surrounding country.
    arabic: 'وفي اليوم التالي ذهب إلى مدينةٍ تدعى نايين وذهب معه كثيرون من تلاميذه وجمعٌ كثيرٌ فلما اقترب إلى باب المدينة إذا ميتٌ محمولٌ ابنٌ وحيدٌ لأمه وهي أرملةٌ ومعها جمعٌ كثيرٌ من المدينة فلما رآها الرب تحنن عليها وقال لها: لا تبكي ثم تقدم ولمس النعش فوقف الحاملون فقال: أيها الشاب لك أقول قم فجلس الميت وابتدأ يتكلم فدفعه إلى أمه فأخذ الجميع خوفٌ ومجدوا الله قائلين: قد قام فينا نبيٌ عظيمٌ وافتقد الله شعبه وخرج هذا الخبر عنه في كل اليهودية وفي جميع الكورة المحيطة'
