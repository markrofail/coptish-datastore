    - Therefore take heed how you hear. For whoever has, to him more will be given; and whoever does not have, even what he seems to have will be taken from him." Then His mother and brothers came to Him, and could not approach Him because of the crowd. And it was told Him by some, who said, "Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside, desiring to see You." But He answered and said to them, "My mother and My brothers are these who hear the word of God and do it."
  arabic:
    - 'فانظروا كيف تسمعون لأن من له سيعطى ومن ليس له فالذي يظنه له يؤخذ منه وجاء إليه أمه وإخوته ولم يقدروا أن يصلوا إليه لسبب الجمع فأخبروه: أمك وإخوتك واقفون خارجاً يريدون أن يروك فأجاب: أمي وإخوتي هم الذين يسمعون كلمة الله ويعملون بها'
