    english: And the Child grew and became strong in spirit, filled with wisdom; and the grace of God was upon Him. His parents went to Jerusalem every year at the Feast of the Passover. And when He was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem according to the custom of the feast. When they had finished the days, as they returned, the Boy Jesus lingered behind in Jerusalem. And Joseph and His mother did not know it; but supposing Him to have been in the company, they went a day's journey, and sought Him among their relatives and acquaintances. So when they did not find Him, they returned to Jerusalem, seeking Him. Now so it was that after three days they found Him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, both listening to them and asking them questions. And all who heard Him were astonished at His understanding and answers. So when they saw Him, they were amazed; and His mother said to Him, "Son, why have You done this to us? Look, Your father and I have sought You anxiously." And He said to them, "Why did you seek Me? Did you not know that I must be about My Father's business?" But they did not understand the statement which He spoke to them. Then He went down with them and came to Nazareth, and was subject to them, but His mother kept all these things in her heart. And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men.
    arabic: 'وكان الصبي ينمو ويتقوى بالروح ممتلئاً حكمةً وكانت نعمة الله عليه وكان أبواه يذهبان كل سنةٍ إلى أورشليم في عيد الفصح ولما كانت له اثنتا عشرة سنةً صعدوا إلى أورشليم كعادة العيد وبعدما أكملوا الأيام بقي عند رجوعهما الصبي يسوع في أورشليم ويوسف وأمه لم يعلما وإذ ظناه بين الرفقة ذهبا مسيرة يومٍ وكانا يطلبانه بين الأقرباء والمعارف ولما لم يجداه رجعا إلى أورشليم يطلبانه وبعد ثلاثة أيامٍ وجداه في الهيكل جالساً في وسط المعلمين يسمعهم ويسألهم وكل الذين سمعوه بهتوا من فهمه وأجوبته فلما أبصراه اندهشا وقالت له أمه: يا بني لماذا فعلت بنا هكذا هوذا أبوك وأنا كنا نطلبك معذبين فقال لهما: لماذا كنتما تطلبانني ألم تعلما أنه ينبغي أن أكون في ما لأبي فلم يفهما الكلام الذي قاله لهما ثم نزل معهما وجاء إلى الناصرة وكان خاضعاً لهما وكانت أمه تحفظ جميع هذه الأمور في قلبها وأما يسوع فكان يتقدم في الحكمة والقامة والنعمة عند الله والناس'
