  english:
    - Then He went down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and was teaching them on the Sabbaths. And they were astonished at His teaching, for His word was with authority. Now in the synagogue there was a man who had a spirit of an unclean demon. And he cried out with a loud voice, saying, "Let us alone! What have we to do with You, Jesus of Nazareth? Did You come to destroy us? I know who You are--the Holy One of God!" But Jesus rebuked him, saying, "Be quiet, and come out of him!" And when the demon had thrown him in their midst, it came out of him and did not hurt him. Then they were all amazed and spoke among themselves, saying, "What a word this is! For with authority and power He commands the unclean spirits, and they come out." And the report about Him went out into every place in the surrounding region.
  arabic:
    - 'وانحدر إلى كفرناحوم مدينةٍ من الجليل وكان يعلمهم في السبوت فبهتوا من تعليمه لأن كلامه كان بسلطانٍ وكان في المجمع رجلٌ به روح شيطانٍ نجسٍ فصرخ بصوتٍ عظيمٍ: آه ما لنا ولك يا يسوع الناصري أتيت لتهلكنا أنا أعرفك من أنت: قدوس الله فانتهره يسوع قائلاً: اخرس واخرج منه فصرعه الشيطان في الوسط وخرج منه ولم يضره شيئاً فوقعت دهشةٌ على الجميع وكانوا يخاطبون بعضهم بعضاً قائلين: ما هذه الكلمة لأنه بسلطانٍ وقوةٍ يأمر الأرواح النجسة فتخرج وخرج صيتٌ عنه إلى كل موضعٍ في الكورة المحيطة'
