    arabic: يوحنا ١:١٤-١٧
text:
    english: And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth. John bore witness of Him and cried out, saying, "This was He of whom I said, "He who comes after me is preferred before me, for He was before me."' And of His fullness we have all received, and grace for grace. For the law was given through Moses, but grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.
    arabic: 'والكلمة صار جسداً وحل بيننا ورأينا مجده مجداً كما لوحيدٍ من الآب مملوءاً نعمةً وحقاً يوحنا شهد له ونادى: هذا هو الذي قلت عنه: إن الذي يأتي بعدي صار قدامي لأنه كان قبلي ومن ملئه نحن جميعاً أخذنا ونعمةً فوق نعمةٍ لأن الناموس بموسى أعطي أما النعمة والحق فبيسوع المسيح صارا'
