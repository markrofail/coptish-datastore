              - O Master, Lord our God, the great and the eternal, who are wondrous in glory;
              - who keeps his covenant and his mercy unto them who love him with all their heart;
              - who has given to us redemption from sins through his only-begotten son, Jesus Christ, our Lord, the life of everyone,
              - the help of those who flee to him, the hope of those who cry unto him.
              - Before whom stand thousands of thousands and ten thousand times ten thousands of holy angels and archangels,
              - the Cherubim and the Seraphim and all the innumerable host of the heavenly powers.
              - O God, who has sanctified these gifts which are set fourth, through the coming down upon them of your holy spirit, you have purified them.
              - Purify us also, our Master, form our sins, the hidden and manifest; and every thought which is not pleasing to your goodness, God the philanthropic one, may it be far from us.

              - so that with a pure heart, and enlightened soul, and unashamed face, a faith unfeigned, a perfect love, and firm hope,
              - 'we may dare with boldness without fear to pray to you, O God the holy Father who are in the heavens and say: Our Father...'
